#Images
arXiv's branding uses both photographs and illustrations. Photos are used alone or paired with our [tagline](tagline). Illustrations capture abstract concepts well and are used in presentations and documentation.

***Important*** Please note that we must ensure we have the right to use photos and illustrations. All assets within arXiv image libraries have been cleared for use in arXiv materials only, use for other purposes is not covered.

##Photos <a href="https://cornell.box.com/v/arXiv-photo-library" class="button-fancy">Go to the arXiv Photo Library <span> </span></a>

Photographs are an important part of the arXiv visual brand. Our curated photo collection represent academic spaces, researchers, labs, and other research-related subject matter. Images of the Cornell and Cornell Tech campuses help create a sense of place, and portraiture humanizes the vast community of people who rely on arXiv.

We apply color washes to photos in our brand colors of Warm Grey, Bright Blue, Dark Blue, and (as in the example below) Salmon.

Photographs can be overlayed with a type treatment as seen here. Learn more on our [tagline](tagline) page.

##Illustrations <a href="https://cornell.box.com/v/arXiv-illustration-library" class="button-fancy">Go to the arXiv Illustration Library <span> </span></a>

Illustrations are used to represent abstract concepts or stakeholder groups. The illustrative style we use is informal and friendly. It is not slick or polished, but emphasizes thrift and mission focus, with a touch of gentle humor. People are represented by stick figures with no gender or other identifying features. Our primary accent color for illustrations is Bright Blue.

##Portraits <a href="https://cornell.box.com/s/thg5f7qaxmfvr2yawv1vb85inaz9acu4" class="button-fancy">Go to the arXiv Portrait Library <span> </span></a>

We stylize staff and other stakeholder portraits with a color wash and square crop. Here are two examples in Dark Blue and Warm Grey:
