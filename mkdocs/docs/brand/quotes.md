#Quotes
Quotes from community members and stakeholders are a powerful way to strenghthen the arXiv message, and to bring a human voice to our digital product.

Quotes must have permission from the quotee to be cleared for use. We maintain a collection of cleared quotes in our [User Experience Hub](https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/browse/AUXDH-1306?jql=project%20%3D%20AUXDH%20AND%20issuetype%20%3D%20Observation%20AND%20%22UX%20Quote%5BCheckboxes%5D%22%20%3D%20%22Permission%20granted%22%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC)

All arXiv staff should be proactive in listening for and getting permission to use great quotes. They greatly enrich presentations and communication materials, and strengthen our ties with a variety of communities as we echo the voices of their members. If you hear of a good quote let the Communications Director know so we can request permission and get it on record!
