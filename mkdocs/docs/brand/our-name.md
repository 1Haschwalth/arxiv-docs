#Pronouncing the arXiv Name
We get it... pronouncing our name is not obvious! Following are the correct ways of saying and writing our name. **We share the right pronunciation and spelling through example and repetition, not admonition.**

##Speaking arXiv
arXiv (/är kīv/) is pronounced like the word ‘archive’. The ‘X’ in our name is the chi symbol used in mathematics, physics, and other fields. The chi is most accurately pronounced like the ‘ch’ in the scottish word loch, but in common use is pronounced like the english letter ‘k’. Some people refer to it as ‘the arXiv’. Internally we do not precede the name with ‘the’, but this is a longstanding convention among some users and both are considered correct.

##Writing arXiv
arXiv is always written with a lowercase ‘a’ and a capitalized ‘X’. It is not preceded by the word ‘the’. We know our spelling is a little unusual and we never correct someone who gets its wrong.
