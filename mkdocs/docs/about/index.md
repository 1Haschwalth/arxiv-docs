# About arXiv

arXiv® is a free distribution service and an open archive for scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. arXiv is a collaboratively funded, community-supported resource founded by Paul Ginsparg in 1991 and maintained and operated by [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/).

Operations are maintained by the [arXiv Leadership Team](/about/people/leadership_team.md) and arXiv staff at Cornell, with the help of numerous volunteer subject moderators. Governance of arXiv is led by the Leadership Team with guidance from the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board and the arXiv Member Advisory Board. arXiv is funded by Cornell University, the [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org), [member institutions](/about/ourmembers.md), and [donors](/about/give.md).

Registered users may [submit articles](None) to be announced by arXiv. Submissions to arXiv are subject to a [moderation process](/help/moderation.md) that classifies material as topical to the subject area and has scholarly value. Material is not peer-reviewed by arXiv - the content of arXiv submissions are wholly the responsibility of the submitter and are presented “as is” without any warranty or guarantee. By hosting works and other materials on this site, arXiv, Cornell University, and their agents do not in any way convey implied approval of the assumptions, methods, results, or conclusions of the work.
