# Instructions for Submission

The Submitter is an original author of the Work, or a proxy pre-approved by arXiv administrators acting on behalf of an original author.  By submitting the work to arXiv, the Submitter is: 

- Representing and warranting that the Submitter holds the right to make the submission, without conflicting with or violating rights of other persons.
- Granting a license permitting the work to be included in arXiv in analog, digital, or other formats as arXiv may deem appropriate, including variations of the work as source files, compiled PDF, machine readable text.
- Agreeing that arXiv reserves the right to reclassify or reject any submission.
- Agreeing that submissions will be automatically compared with other arXiv articles and detected text overlap may be noted.
- Agreeing that metadata may be corrected to conform to arXiv standards and that metadata will be available under a [Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
- Agreeing not to sue or seek to recover damages from arXiv, Cornell University, or affiliated individuals based on arXiv's actions in connection with your submission including refusal to accept, categorization, removal, or exercise of any other rights granted under the Submittal Agreement.
- Agreeing to not enter into other agreements or make other commitments that would conflict with the rights granted to arXiv.

arXiv is a repository for scholarly material, and perpetual access is necessary to maintain the scholarly record.  Therefore, arXiv strives to maintain a permanent collection of submitted works, including actions taken with respect to each work.  Nevertheless, arXiv reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to take any action including to removal of a work or blocking access to it, in the event that arXiv determines that such action is required in order to comply with applicable arXiv policies and laws.   Submitters should take care to submit a work to arXiv _only if they are certain_ that they will not later wish to publish it in a journal or other outlet that prohibits prior distribution on an e-print server. _arXiv will not remove an announced article in order to comply with such a journal policy – the license granted on submission is irrevocable._

arXiv is a service of Cornell University, and all rights and obligations of arXiv are held and exercised by Cornell University.
