Submission of HTML+JPEG/PNG/GIF
-------------------------------

If you are using a word processor, you may be able to save your document
in HTML+JPEG/PNG/GIF format; in this format the equations are included
as small PNG or GIF images and photographic images would be provided in
JPEG format. This format is not a good option for papers which have many
equations. For all but the simplest documents you are likely to get
better results by [exporting PDF](/help/submit_pdf.md) from your word processor
(e.g. MS Word) and submitting that instead.

If you do choose to submit HTML, please check the following:

-   Make sure that any links in your paper are relative links and that
    no links point to external URLs.
-   Make sure all files are in the same directory. Processing will fail
    if you attempt to use subdirectories.
-   Check your HTML with your web browser before submitting. Bugs in the
    word processing software often result in long stretches of text in
    the improper font. These are easy to fix by hand. For example, to
    end a section in boldface, one needs a closing `</b>` in the HTML
    file.
