Submitters to arXiv agree to the following policy statements:

- I confirm that I have the rights to agree to the license designated for this
  submission.
- I understand that submissions cannot be completely removed once accepted.
- I understand that arXiv.org reserves the right to reclassify or reject any
  submission.
- I understand that submissions will be automatically compared with other arXiv
  articles and detected text overlap may be noted.
- I understand that metadata may be corrected to conform to arXiv standards.

For third-party submissions, I have obtained pre-authorization from arXiv to
submit as a third-party submitter.
