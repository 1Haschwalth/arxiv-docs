            <h1 id="computer-science-subject-areas-and-moderators">Computer Science Subject Areas and Moderators</h1>
<p>Papers in the <a href="./">Computing Research Repository (CoRR)</a> are classified in two ways: by subject area from a list of subjects listed below and by using the 1998 ACM Computing Classification System. The ACM classification scheme provides us with a relatively stable scheme that covers all of computer science. The subject areas are not mutually exclusive, nor do they (yet) provide complete coverage of the field. On the other hand, we hope that they better reflect the active areas of research in CS. We expect to add more subject areas and subdivide current subject areas according to demand. Authors who cannot find an appropriate subject area should use subject area Other. We welcome constructive <a href="/help/contact">comments and suggestions</a>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.AI/recent">AI - Artificial Intelligence</a></strong> - Diego Calvanese, Julien Corman, and Ognjen Savkovic</p>
<p>Covers all areas of AI except Vision, Robotics, Machine Learning, Multiagent Systems, and Computation and Language (Natural Language Processing), which have separate subject areas.

For work on cloud computing, consider cs.DC, cs.AR, cs.NI or cs.CE, depending on the focus. For watermarking, consider cs.MM and cs.CR.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.FL/recent">FL - Formal Languages and Automata Theory</a></strong> - Michael Domaratzki</p>
<p>Covers automata theory, formal language theory, grammars, and combinatorics on words. This roughly corresponds to ACM Subject Classes F.1.1, and F.4.3. Papers dealing with computational complexity should go to cs.CC; papers dealing with logic should go to cs.LO. Papers that simply make use of automata, transducers, grammars, and so on, are not appropriate unless the automata, transducers, or grammars are the main subjects of study.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.GT/recent">GT - Computer Science and Game Theory</a></strong> - Michal Feldman, David Parkes, Moshe Tennenholtz</p>
<p>Covers all theoretical and applied aspects at the intersection of computer science and game theory, including work in mechanism design, learning in games (which may overlap with Machine Learning), foundations of agent modeling in games (which may overlap with Multiagent systems), coordination, specification and formal methods for non-cooperative computational environments. The area also deals with applications of game theory to areas such as electronic commerce.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.GL/recent">GL - General Literature</a></strong> - Joe Halpern</p>
<p>Covers introductory material, survey material, predictions of future trends, biographies, and miscellaneous computer-science related material. Roughly includes all of ACM Subject Class A, except it does not include conference proceedings (which will be listed in the appropriate subject area).</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.GR/recent">GR - Graphics</a></strong> - Stephen Spencer and David Salesin</p>
<p>Covers all aspects of computer graphics. Roughly includes material in all of ACM Subject Class I.3, except that I.3.5 is is likely to have Computational Geometry as the primary subject area.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.AR/recent">AR - Hardware Architecture</a></strong> - Onur Mutlu</p>
<p>Covers systems organization and architecture. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes C.0, C.1, and C.5.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.HC/recent">HC - Human-Computer Interaction</a></strong> - Terry Winograd and Michael Bernstein</p>
<p>Covers human factors, user interfaces, and collaborative computing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes H.1.2 and all of H.5, except for H.5.1, which is more likely to have Multimedia as the primary subject area.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.IR/recent">IR - Information Retrieval</a></strong> - James Allan</p>
<p>Covers indexing, dictionaries, retrieval, content and analysis. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes H.3.0, H.3.1, H.3.2, H.3.3, and H.3.4.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.IT/recent">IT - Information Theory</a></strong> - Venkat Guruswami and Muriel Medard</p>
<p>Covers theoretical and experimental aspects of information theory and coding. Includes material in ACM Subject Class E.4 and intersects with H.1.1.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.LG/recent">LG - Machine Learning</a></strong> - Tom Dieterrich, Sebastian Raschka and Luis Lamb</p>
<p>Papers on all aspects of machine learning research (supervised,
unsupervised, reinforcement learning, bandit problems, and so on)
including also robustness, explanation, fairness, and
methodology. cs.LG is also an appropriate primary category for
applications of machine learning methods.</p>
<p><em>Relationship to other categories</em>: If the primary domain of the
application is available as another category in arXiv and readers of
that category would be the main audience, that category should be
primary. Examples include applications to computer vision (cs.CV),
natural language processing (cs.CL), speech recognition (eess.AS),
information retrieval (cs.IR; includes document classification and
topic modeling), crowdsourcing (cs.HC), quantitative finance (<a href="/archive/q-fin">q-fin</a>),
and quantitative biology (<a href="/archive/q-bio">q-bio</a>). Papers discussing the foundations of
neural network architectures (activation functions, spiking neurons,
etc.) should list cs.NE as primary, as should papers applying
biologically-inspired optimization techniques such as evolutionary
methods. Papers working with the properties of specific signal types
(e.g., sound, EEG, hyperspectral, ultrasound) should consider cs.SD
(sound, including music), eess.IV (images and video), or eess.SP as
primary. cs.LG is not appropriate for papers studying human learning
such as computer-aided instruction, where cs.CY is a better
fit. Papers categorized with cs.LG as primary are automatically
cross-listed as stat.ML and vice versa.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.LO/recent">LO - Logic in Computer Science</a></strong> - Gopalan Nadathur</p>
<p>Covers all aspects of logic in computer science, including finite model theory, logics of programs, modal logic, and program verification. Programming language semantics should have Programming Languages as the primary subject area. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes D.2.4, F.3.1, F.4.0, F.4.1, and F.4.2; some material in F.4.3 (formal languages) may also be appropriate here, although Computational Complexity is typically the more appropriate subject area.</p>

<p>Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Class G.4.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.MA/recent">MA - Multiagent Systems</a></strong> - Jose Vidal</p>

<p>Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes D.4.1, D.4.2., D.4.3, D.4.4, D.4.5, D.4.7, and D.4.9.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.OH/recent">OH - Other</a></strong> - Joe Halpern</p>
<p>This is the classification to use for documents that do not fit anywhere else. This category should not be used if other categories seem appropriate.</p>

<p>Covers the design, analysis, and modeling of social and information networks, including their applications for on-line information access, communication, and interaction, and their roles as datasets in the exploration of questions in these and other domains, including connections to the social and biological sciences. Analysis and modeling of such networks includes topics in ACM Subject classes F.2, G.2, G.3, H.2, and I.2; applications in computing include topics in H.3, H.4, and H.5; and applications at the interface of computing and other disciplines include topics in J.1--J.7. Papers on computer communication systems and network protocols (e.g. TCP/IP) are generally a closer fit to the Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI) category.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.SE/recent">SE - Software Engineering</a></strong> - Stéphane Ducasse and Nicolas Anquetil</p>
<p>Covers design tools, software metrics, testing and debugging, programming environments, etc. Roughly includes material in all of ACM Subject Classes D.2, except that D.2.4 (program verification) should probably have Logics in Computer Science as the primary subject area.</p>
<p><strong><a href="/list/cs.SD/recent">SD - Sound</a></strong> - Michael O'Donnell</p>
<p>Covers all aspects of computing with sound, and sound as an information channel. Includes models of sound, analysis and synthesis, audio user interfaces, sonification of data, computer music, and sound signal processing. Includes ACM Subject Class H.5.5, and intersects with H.1.2, H.5.1, H.5.2, I.2.7, I.5.4, I.6.3, J.5, K.4.2.</p>
