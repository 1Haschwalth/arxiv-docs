{# ========== Template for main.html ========== 

This is a jinja template to creates main.html for arxiv custom mkdocs
theme. The main.html is also a jinja template.

It is processed by starting up a flask app with arxiv-base that
renders the Jinja template in this file. The output of that processing
is a jinja template found at mkdocs/arxiv_doc_theme/main.html.

By rendering this template with arxiv-base a new template for use by
mkdocs as overrides to the mkdocs-material theme are created.

All the jinja directives in this file will be evaluated at the custom template
generation level first. Then when mkdoc is run that template will be evaulated.

So this comment will not appear in the custom theme tempalate. But a
comment surrounded by raw tags will show up in the custom tempate but
at mkdocs eval time it will not be added to the HTML output.

For details about how to customize mkdocs-material via overrides see
