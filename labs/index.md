    summary: |
      arXiv Bibliographic Explorer displays information about works that cite
      and are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. The primary
      objective of the project is to enable discovery of relevant research and
      context by providing user-friendly navigation of an article's citation
      tree.

    summary: |
      Our top priority is to provide a high-quality service to all arXiv authors
      and readers. The overarching objective of this project is to significantly
      improve the usability and accessibility of arXiv papers. While providing
      HTML is not a panacea, it is a first step in the right direction.

    summary: |
      arXiv Links to Code aims to provide an easy and convenient way to
      find relevant code for a paper. It is using data from
      <a href="https://paperswithcode.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      Papers with Code</a> - a free resource that links papers, code and
      results in Machine Learning. Papers with Code is the biggest such resource and is licensed under an open license.

# arXiv Labs

arXiv is surrounded by a community of researchers and developers working at the cutting edge of information science and technology.

While the arXiv team is focused on our core mission—providing rapid dissemination of research findings at no cost to readers and submitters—we are excited to be experimenting with a small number of collaborators on projects that add value for our stakeholders and advance research.

Here are some of the projects that our collaborators are working on right now.

We are grateful to the [volunteer developers](https://arxiv.org/about/people/developers) who contribute to the arXiv codebase and invite you to get involved. Please see our [guidelines for contributors](https://github.com/arXiv/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), or contact nextgen@arxiv.org, for more information about contributing to arXiv software development.
If you are interested in proposing a new arXiv Labs project, please <a href="#" onclick="pendo.feedback.openFeedback(event)">submit a proposal</a>.
