# arXivLabs: An invitation to collaborate 

arXivLabs is a framework for enabling the arXiv community to contribute to arXiv and develop tools that can benefit the scientific community. 

arXiv welcomes anyone, from single individuals to large companies, to contribute and share their products and services, as long as they abide by the same arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.

arXivLabs projects are categorized under the following criteria:

1. **Labs4U** Projects that leverage arXiv services, and have an operational agreement or understanding, but are maintained and deployed fully outside of arXiv. These projects meet minimal technical criteria, and may need funding to offset costs. This category includes research projects, as well as external applications (such as mobile apps or mirror sites) and widgets on external websites. 
2. **Labs4Production** Experimental projects maintained by external collaborators and deployed (in whole or part) on arXiv infrastructure. These projects must meet additional technical criteria.
3. **Labs4Core** Experimental projects that add a great deal of value to the arXiv platform, and which are deemed feasible to maintain by the core arXiv IT team, may be incorporated as a core feature or service. These projects undergo additional rigorous scrutiny to ensure maintainability, security, and reliability.

In order to apply to be part of the arXivLabs community, learn more about the [criteria](https://labs.arxiv.org/criteria) and then tell us about your idea by contacting nextgen@arxiv.org. And, check out other projects in our [arXivLabs showcase](https://labs.arxiv.org/showcase).

Please also note that many projects that use arXiv’s APIs are not arXivLabs projects. Learn more about [arXiv API data usage here.](https://arxiv.org/help/api/)

_NB: Use of the names “arXiv”, “arXiv.org”, “arXiv Labs”, “arXivLabs” and associated logos, web addresses and colors are only allowed with the explicit written permission from the arXiv management team._
