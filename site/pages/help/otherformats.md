Submission of PDF/PS
====================

If your paper was written in a word processor (e.g. Word, WordPerfect),
we require you to submit it in either the PDF or PS format.

See our help pages on considerations for [submitting PDF](submit_pdf.md) or
[submitting PostScript](submit_ps.md) for more information.
