arXiv mirror sites
==================

In addition to the [main site](http://arxiv.org) at Cornell University
Library, there are several mirror sites for arXiv content. These are
updated daily but have fewer features than the main site:

-   [cn.arXiv.org](http://cn.arxiv.org/) (China)
-   [de.arXiv.org](http://de.arxiv.org/) (Germany)
-   [in.arXiv.org](http://in.arxiv.org/) (India)
-   [lanl.arXiv.org](http://lanl.arxiv.org/) (n√©e xxx.lanl.gov, U.S.
    mirror at Los Alamos)
-   [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) (U.S. primary site at Cornell
    University)

*2015-11: We are in the process of discontinuing the arXiv mirror
network. Geographic locality of servers is much less useful now than it
was when the mirror network was established, and maintaining support for
mirrors impedes development of new features on arXiv. We will continue
to support and extend [APIs and data feeds](bulk_data.md) to enable third
parties to develop services over arXiv.*

2018-03: The Spanish mirror (formerly es.arxiv.org) has been taken
offline temporarily due to system problems.  
2016-04: The French mirror (formerly fr.arxiv.org) has been
discontinued.  
2015-12: The Japan mirror (formerly jp.arxiv.org) has been
discontinued.  
2014-11: The United Kingdom mirror (formerly uk.arxiv.org) has been
discontinued.  
2012-10: The Israeli mirror (formerly il.arxiv.org) has been
discontinued.  
2012-08: The Taiwan mirror (formerly tw.arxiv.org) has been
discontinued.  
2012-04: The Brazilian and Russian mirrors (formerly br.arxiv.org and
ru.arxiv.org) have been discontinued.  
2012-02: The APS and Australian mirrors (formerly aps.arxiv.org and
au.arxiv.org) have been discontinued.  
2009-01: The Italian mirror (formerly it.arxiv.org) has been
discontinued.  
2008-12: The South Korean mirror (formerly kr.arXiv.org) has been
discontinued.  
2007-06: The South Africa mirror (formerly za.arXiv.org) has been
discontinued.
