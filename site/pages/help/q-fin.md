The Quantitative Finance (q-fin) archive (3/2014)
=================================================

The Quantitative Finance archive ([q-fin](/archive/q-fin)) was
[introduced](q-fin/announcement) 1 December 2008. It was expanded with
new categories in February 2014. For more detailed background and
explanation of the objectives, see the original q-fin announcement.

been reclassified to link with their appropriate new subject category.
