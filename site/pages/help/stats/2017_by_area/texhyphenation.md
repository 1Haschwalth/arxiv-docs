Hyphenation Patterns for Languages other than American English
==============================================================

Our standard LaTeX installation supports only the default `american`
hyphenation pattern and `nohyphenation`. However, you may request an
extended version of LaTeX that supports the following hyphenation
patterns:

>     american
>     british
>     french
>     german
>     ngerman
>     danish
>     dutch
>     italian
>     portuges
>     spanish
>     nohyphenation

To request the extended version of LaTeX please add the following line
to the top of the main LaTeX file in your submission:

>     %&biglatex

We do not support additional hyphenation patterns for plain TeX.
