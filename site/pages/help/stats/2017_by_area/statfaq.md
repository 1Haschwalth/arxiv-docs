Frequently Asked Questions on Public Statistics
===============================================

-   ### This is pure vanity, but I'd like to know how many people (and even who) have been retrieving my paper. Are there any plans to add this facility?

    No.

-   ### Why not?

    *Such "statistics" are difficult to assess for a variety of
    reasons.*

    While e-mail, ftp, and web statistics for individual papers are
    accumulated at arXiv.org (primarily for assessing the overall
    activity levels of archive), there are as well many other access
    points for these archives, including mirror sites and local
    redistribution points (not to mention local photocopying, etc.). For
    example, there are sites that simply download everything either for
    local printing or local caching; so there's sometimes an automatic
    lower bound on the raw number of accesses, which is not necessarily
    a measure of readership. On the other hand, this distributed access
    means as well that many papers may be significantly undercounted if
    one takes into account only the centralized public distribution
    points.

    There are as well other distorting factors. For example a paper's
    initial submission may have some minor technical processing problem,
    corrected by a quick replacement the next day, and hence have many
    2nd requests for a viewable version, perhaps artificially doubling
    the initial raw number of requests.

    In addition, it is impossible to distinguish between actual reading
    and browsing or other spurious requests. For example, many
    physicists tend to use these papers as a substitute for memory --
    i.e. they know a paper with a particular equation, so get it just
    for that equation then delete it (should that count as reading?).

    *So before publicizing any such statistics, all the caveats would
    have to be clearly understood.*

    But then the very availability of statistics could have many
    undesirable consequences. Some segment of submitters might find it
    highly embarrassing to see how little read is (and consequently how
    little impact has) their magnum opus on which they've expended so
    much quality time and effort. Furthermore, we don't wish to
    encourage people to try somehow to distort public statistics in
    their favor either by self-generating large numbers of requests, or
    by repeated replacement of their submission to generate multiple
    repeat requests.

    It could be argued perhaps correctly that statistics may provide
    some useful information at least on the *relative* popularity of
    submissions, since the distributed access and other factors may be
    subsumable into some overall scale factor. But even this information
    is ambiguous in many cases, and publicizing, even when accurate,
    could merely accentuate faddishness in fields already excessively
    faddish.

    *Most significantly*, however, there is a strong philosophic reason
    for not publicizing (or even saving) these statistics. When one
    browses in a library it is very important (in fact legislated) that
    big brother is not watching through a camera mounted on the wall;
    for the benefit of readers it is very important to maintain in every
    way possible this sense of freedom from monitoring in the electronic
    realm.

-   ### But it used to be that I could receive preprint/reprint requests by mail, and thereby identify people with similar interests. Aren't I losing something?

    No.

    You can add explicitly at the top of your paper something like:

    > "If you have read this paper and wish to be included in a mailing
    > list (or other means of communication) that I maintain on the
    > subject, then send e-mail To: me@my.email.address ."

    A few moments' reflection will convince you that this is a much more
    effective means of identifying parties truly interested in your
    research, as opposed to random passersby.

-   ### Do you plan to use download statistics in any way?

    Yes.
