arXiv monthly submission **rate** statistics, 31 Dec '05
========================================================

(for the four largest "subject areas": "hep" = High Energy Physics,
"cond-mat" = Condensed Matter Physics, "astro-ph" = Astrophysics, "math"
= Mathematics) ![](hcam_avg.png)  
Blue/Green/Red/Purple - Average number of submissions/month as a
function of calendar year for hep/cond-mat/astro-ph/math(+math-ph).  
While the astro-ph submission rate is likely to saturate and flatten out
(as hep did starting in '95), the cond-mat rate grew to exceed the hep
rate in calendar year '05 and is expected to continue growing for
another decade. math(+math-ph) has been growing even faster since 2002.

![](hep_monthly.png)  
Blue - Number of new hep (= hep-th/hep-ph/hep-lat/hep-ex) submissions
received during each month since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to hep in
clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](cond-mat_monthly.png)  
Green - Number of new cond-mat submissions received during each month
since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to cond-mat in clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](astro-ph_monthly.png)  
Red - Number of new astro-ph submissions received during each month
since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to astro-ph in clear)

The current submission rates (i.e. averaged over calendar year '05) as
percentages of the average '05
[overall](http://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions) average rate of
3903/month are roughly:

-   cond-mat: 19.7%
-   math(+math-ph): 18.9%
-   astro-ph: 18.7%
-   hep: 18.5%

> (The '05 submission rates for the [remaining](remmonthly.html) subject
> areas are:  
> quant-ph: 6.1%, physics(other): 5.9%, gr-qc: 3.6%, nucl: 3.3%, cs:
> 2.6%, nlin: 1.6%, q-bio: 1.2% )

The total number of submissions to date as percentages of the total
350453 submissions (i.e. Aug '91 through Dec '05) are roughly:

-   hep: 28.7%
-   cond-mat: 19.4%
-   astro-ph: 18.4%

> (The overall percentages to date for the remaining subject areas
> are:  
> [math(+math-ph)](math_monthly.png): 12.8%,
> [quant-ph](quant-ph_monthly.png): 4.9%, [gr-qc](gr-qc_monthly.png):
> 4.2%, [nucl](nucl_monthly.png): 3.8%,
> [physics(other)](physics_monthly.png): 3.5%, [nlin](nlin_monthly.png):
> 2.2%, [cs](cs_monthly.png): 1.7% , [q-bio](q-bio_monthly.png): 0.4% )

<span id="upper">For the first half of calendar year '03:</span> **84%**
of the new submissions came via web upload, **16%** via the original
e-mail interface, and **2%** via anonymous ftp upload. (The web upload
was enabled in June '96 after a multi-year wait for browsers to support
it. E-mail and ftp submissions were disabled in Jul '03.) For years
