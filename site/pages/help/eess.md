Electrical Engineering and Systems Science archive (September 2017)
===================================================================

The Electrical Engineering and Systems Science archive
([eess](/archive/eess)) was [introduced](/help/eess/announcement) 18
September 2017.

Analytical and computational aspects of Electrical Engineering
(including Signals, Systems, Communications, Networking, and Information
Theory and Methods) and Systems Science in a broader sense that includes
Dynamical Systems and Control research motivated by electrical,
chemical, mechanical, aerospace and other cross-disciplinary (e.g.,
vehicular) engineering applications, as well as the analysis,
optimization and control of cyber-physical systems such as power grids
and the Internet of Things.

Subject categories of the **eess** archive are:

-   **eess.AS - Audio and Speech Processing**  
    Theory and methods for processing signals representing audio,
    speech, and language, and their applications. This includes
    analysis, synthesis, enhancement, transformation, classification and
    interpretation of such signals as well as the design, development,
    and evaluation of associated signal processing systems. Machine
    learning and pattern analysis applied to any of the above areas is
    also welcome. Specific topics of interest include: auditory modeling
    and hearing aids; acoustic beamforming and source localization;
    classification of acoustic scenes; speaker separation; active noise
    control and echo cancellation; enhancement; de-reverberation;
    bioacoustics; music signals analysis, synthesis and modification;
    music information retrieval; audio for multimedia and joint
    audio-video processing; spoken and written language modeling,
    segmentation, tagging, parsing, understanding, and translation; text
    mining; speech production, perception, and psychoacoustics; speech
    analysis, synthesis, and perceptual modeling and coding; robust
    speech recognition; speaker recognition and characterization; deep
    learning, online learning, and graphical models applied to speech,
    audio, and language signals; and implementation aspects ranging from
    system architecture to fast algorithms.

-   **eess.IV - Image and Video Processing**  
    Theory, algorithms, and architectures for the formation, capture,
    processing, communication, analysis, and display of images, video,
    and multidimensional signals in a wide variety of applications.
    Topics of interest include: mathematical, statistical, and
    perceptual image and video modeling and representation; linear and
    nonlinear filtering, de-blurring, enhancement, restoration, and
    reconstruction from degraded, low-resolution or tomographic data;
    lossless and lossy compression and coding; segmentation, alignment,
    and recognition; image rendering, visualization, and printing;
    computational imaging, including ultrasound, tomographic and
    magnetic resonance imaging; and image and video analysis, synthesis,
    storage, search and retrieval.  
    Moderator: Antonio Ortega
-   **eess.SP - Signal Processing**  
    Theory, algorithms, performance analysis and applications of signal
    and data analysis, including physical modeling, processing,
    detection and parameter estimation, learning, mining, retrieval, and
    information extraction. The term "signal" includes speech, audio,
    sonar, radar, geophysical, physiological, (bio-) medical, image,
    video, and multimodal natural and man-made signals, including
    communication signals and data. Topics of interest include:
    statistical signal processing, spectral estimation and system
    identification; filter design, adaptive filtering / stochastic
    learning; (compressive) sampling, sensing, and transform-domain
    methods including fast algorithms; signal processing for machine
    learning and machine learning for signal processing applications;
    in-network and graph signal processing; convex and nonconvex
    optimization methods for signal processing applications; radar,
    sonar, and sensor array beamforming and direction finding;
    communications signal processing; low power, multi-core and
    system-on-chip signal processing; sensing, communication, analysis
    and optimization for cyber-physical systems such as power grids and
    the Internet of Things.
