Why the change to arXiv.org ?
=============================

No reason, really.

(Except that archive.org, archives.org, thearchive.org, thearchives.org,
etc., were all already taken. Also note that **arXiv** is pronounced
just like "archive" in some languages.)

And why was it xxx.lanl.gov in the first place?
-----------------------------------------------

Also no real reason. Except that it sounds pretty cool, right? Like some
top-secret super server!

But these are very good questions. Thank you for your interest.
