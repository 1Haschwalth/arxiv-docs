Submission of DOCX/OOXML - No longer supported
==============================================

2011-07-06: Submissions in DOCX format are no longer supported. Please
create a PDF file and [submit](submit_pdf) that instead. Server side
conversion of DOCX to PDF may lead to incorrect font substitutions,
among other problems, and your own PDF is likely to be more accurate.
