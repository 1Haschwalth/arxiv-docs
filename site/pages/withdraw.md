To withdraw an article
======================

Submission not yet announced
----------------------------

If your submission has not yet become [publicly
available](submit#availability) you may delete or delay it. To do either
of these things go to your [user page](http://arxiv.org/user) and select
either the Delete (![delete icon](/images/delete.png)) or Unsubmit
(![unsubmit icon](/images/unsubmit.png)) icon. Deleting a submission
will remove it from our system, unsubmitting will return it to the
[incomplete status](submit_status#incomplete) allowing modification and
later resubmission. If you have difficulty in doing either of these
things then please [contact arXiv administrators](/help/contact)
immediately. In your message be sure to include the submission
identifier, an explanation of the problem, and the reason for
withdrawal.

Article has been announced
--------------------------

Articles that have been announced and made public cannot be completely
removed. However, you may submit a withdrawal notification for your
article. To do this select the Withdraw icon (![withdraw
icon](/images/withdraw.png)) for the appropriate aritcle in the
"Articles You Own" section of your [user page](http://arxiv.org/user).

You **must** provide a specific reason for the withdrawal within the
**Comments** field. Please do not modify the abstract field unless the
comments field is inadequate for your explanation.

Note that arXiv makes all previous versions of submissions publicly
available (since October 1997). Therefore, even though the current
version of a paper may be marked as withdrawn, previous versions can
still be retrieved. See the discussion on [availability of previous
versions](versions).
