Pending Queue
=============

We have implemented a pending queue to allow greater flexibility for
authors, admins, and moderators. It enables us to put papers on "hold
status" prior to the freeze time in cases of paper classification,
technical problems, etc.

What has changed?
-----------------

At upload time (4 pm Eastern US time), papers will be assigned a
**temporary pending-id number**, e.g., pending/3021234. Submitters can
view their papers prior to freeze time by using this pending-id number.

At publish time (8 pm Eastern US time), all papers which are not put on
hold will be assigned their permanent paper-id numbers, e.g.,
cond-mat/0510123. **These paper-id numbers are sent to the submitters'
email addresses.**
