arXiv submission checklist
==========================

arXiv is able to offer free access to scientific literature in part
because we don't have a paid staff of editors. Therefore, submitters
should double-check their submissions *before* they become publicly
available. We've provided a helpful checklist that will help you avoid
common pitfalls; if you take a few minutes to check everything, you'll
help us maintain a quality service and ensure that your work is seen in
the best possible light.

For further hints, see our [help pages](/help).

Please [replace](http://arxiv.org/replace) your submission if you find
that it's deficient in any of the following areas:

1.  Does your paper conform to our [guidelines for properly formatted
    metadata?](http://arXiv.org/help/prep)
2.  Are the Title and Author fields are correct?
3.  Is the abstract complete, correct, and wrapped correctly?
4.  Is capitalization in the title correct? (We automatically lower the
    case of titles with excessive use of upper case, but we get some
    acronyms incorrect -- replace with uppercase letters only where they
    should be).
5.  Are authors are listed in "Firstname Lastname" order?
6.  Are URLs given in standard format? (e.g.
    ftp://myhost.domain/path/filename.ext or
    http://mywwwhost.domain/path/filename.html)
7.  Do URL links actually work?
8.  Are periods separated by a space from the end of any URL's?
9.  MSC-class:, if included, is a single AMS subject classification, or
    several, in the form "\#\#\# (Primary) \#\#\# (Secondary)"?
10. Is any Journal-ref a complete bibliographic reference to an already
    published version (includes volume and page number info in the case
    of a print journal)?
11. Are all files, including PostScript figures, included?
12. Is this the first time the paper was submitted to arXiv?
13. Can the submission be retrieved uncorrupted? (TRY IT).

If your abstract is improperly wrapped, note that abstract linefill
stops at whitespace indentation (e.g. a blank line or a line indented
with space(s) denotes a new paragraph,and won't be wrapped).

**Use our [replace form](http://arxiv.org/replace) to replace a paper.**
You can replace a paper while it is still pending, or replace a paper
once it's been announced to the public. You should **never re-submit a
paper:** instead, make changes via the [replace form](replace.md). If you
believe your paper is of interest to readers of another archive or
subject class, **do not re-submit:** rather, use the
[cross-listing](http://arxiv.org/cross) form.

Notes
-----

1.  **Avoid excessive cross-listings:** cross-listings of a paper on
    archive-x to archive-y are intended for subjects of *direct*
    interest to subscribers of archive-y. Those subscribers of archive-y
    who have peripheral or direct interest in the subjects of archive-x
    are already subscribed to archive-x and neither need nor desire
    multiple receipt of the same abstract. (In particular, it is
    exceedingly unlikely that you could decide what is of direct
    interest to readers of archive-y if you yourself are not an active
    reader of archive-y.)
2.  **Avoid premature submissions:** People are more likely to read new
    submissions than replacements, so it is in your interest to submit a
    correct version of your work in the first place. If you do need to
    replace the submission, please indicate the nature of the revision
    in the Comments: field (e.g. v2: major conceptual changes, v3: minor
    grammatical changes, etc.), and include as a commented header in the
    revised version of the paper a guide to the changes for posterity.
