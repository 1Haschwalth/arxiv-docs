The script for Mosaic is not really that good right now: and we should
probably think a bit more, and probably should talk to the Mosaic guys
as well. That is why I do not yet want to publish it. We can put it up
as an example of how it can be done within the present framework
itself: not as a way in which we think these should be done.
<p>
At the minimum we need Mosaic (and any other www client) 
to set two environmentvariables containing respectively:
(1) its own pid, and (2) The URL of the document it is calling,
and should accept by `remote control' either (a) an absolute URL, OR
(b) a relative URL and a BASE HREF. <br>
(Instead of using an environment variable for (2), it could instead put
the URL into a file and name the file in the environment. 
[Does mac have environment variables? It is easy to overflow
IBM PC environment space].)
<hr>
Anyway, here is how the system on nqcd works. No portability issues
had been considered when writing them: I have tried to express my
concerns below.

<ol>
<li> There is a c-program 
<a href="newpg.c">newpg.c</a> which takes 2 or more parameters.
<ol>
<li> <b>if</b> the first parameter is non-zero, 
it sets its pgid to the first parameter,
<b>else</b> it sets its pgid to its pid.
<li> it replaces itself (without changing pid's) with the program
       named by its second parameter and passes the rest of the
       arguments to it. 
<li>Note that it requires ANSI C, the header <sys/types.h> to define pid_t, and
  the routines setpgid (I haven't checked to see if it exists in
  SYSV) and execvp.
</ol>

<li>The actual Mosaic is renamed Mosaic.binary

<li> <a href="Mosaic">Mosaic</a> 
   is a script that calls the c-program (newpg) which starts the 
   actual Mosaic. (It also provides default values to a few environment
   variables:  only WWWBROWSER is relevant to this project). It should
   work on all unices unchanged provided $0 gets correctly translated,
   and the paths are corrected.

<li> <a href="callmosaic">callmosaic</a> takes two parameters and does the
   following: 
  <ol>
  <li> Ignores the second parameter. See later.
  <li> It clears the PATH environment variable, and changes the MOSAIC
      environment variable, if present, to /usr/local/bin/Mosaic. (As
      a result it uses absolute paths for all system programs,
      bringing in system dependencies). It redirects standard output
      to standard error. (should it?)
  <li> gets its own pgid. (call it x) Doing this from shell is
      extremely machine dependent. (depends on exact format of ps
      output! On some machines like IBM Risc stations, may be next to
      impossible). Should be done with a two line C program instead. 
  <li> checks process with PID x to see if it exists and its
      identification as returned by ps contains the string
      `Mosaic'. If so, goes to step 6. (There may be differences
      between BSD and SYSV ps calls). Probably should also check the
      DISPLAY environment variable, but no sure way of doing that
      unless one call call a process which has group kmem
      permissions. (Unless pstat, which is such a process gives us a
      way of doing it: I do not know). A less than perfect way does
      exist with ps -e.
  <li> checks to see if ${HOME}/.mosaicpid exists and is readable.
      If so, call the pid in it as x (probably crash if file not in
      right format), else go to step 6.
  <li> checks to see if process with PID x exists and its
      identification as returned by ps contains the string
      `Mosaic'. If so goto step 6. (BSD and SYSV ps calls may
      differ). (Note that it does not check to see if the DISPLAY is
      the same! See point 2)
  <li> Start a Mosaic passing it the first parameter; and exit when
      that exits. (should probably `exec' the Mosaic instead. Should
      it also try a ps -x and check for an unique Mosaic on this
      display before it starts a new one? See point 2 about
      display). (The redirection of standard output to standard error
      stays!) (What happens if the parameter contains backquotes?
      Haven't checked!)
  <li> Creates /tmp/Mosaic.x (x being the aforementioned pid) and
      writes two lines into it (probably crashes if it cannot): the
      first being `goto' and the second contains whatever came in as
      the first parameter. Then it signals USR1 to x, and
      exits. (probably should write the second parameter as a third
      line.) (What happens if the parameter contains backquotes?
      Haven't checked!)
   <li>   Note that the second parameter is always ignored. (It is supposed
   to be the BASE HREF of the document which is calling callmosaic).
  </ol>
