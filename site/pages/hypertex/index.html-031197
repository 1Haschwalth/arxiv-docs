It is easier to add hypertext capability to TeX than to simulate
the TeX typesetting environment within www browsers. (And for scientific
text, total author control over formatting and fonts is frequently preferred.)
The standard promoted here is to insert \special commands that add the
necessary structure to the .dvi file. For <a name="burble">example</a>,
<blockquote>
\def\href#1#2{\special{html:&lt;a href="#1"&gt;}{#2}\special{html:&lt;/a&gt;}}
</blockquote>
allows one to surround text with the necessary specials, so that
<blockquote>
Here is a link to \href{http://xxx.lanl.gov/}{xxx}.
</blockquote>
will insert the desired anchored text. The link can be to an arbitrary
network URL (including e.g. photos, movies, sound files, mathematica files,
etc.) Downward compatibility is ensured, since dvi drivers that
do not recognize the \specials will ignore them (although some, such as dvips,
will currently issue warnings at each occurrence).
<p>
The object is not only 
to provide hyperlink functionality to external (network) resources, but also
to provide a means of transmitting much of the
important structural and contextual information (sections, subsections,
equations, references, ...) <a href="#more">already</a> contained in the
underlying .tex for suitable gui postprocessing, whether directly
by .dvi previewer or after higher level translation 
(e.g. to .<a href="#pdf">pdf</a>).

<h2><a name="dvi">dvi Previewers</a></h2>
Two dvi previewers are currently under development to implement this
functionality:
<ul>
<li>The source code for xhdvi, the modified X windows dvi previewer, is
available from <a href="/help/CTANservers.html">CTAN</a>,
courtesy of Arthur Smith (apsmith@aps.org).
The latest version at the time of this (12 May 96) was xhdvi_0.8a, and it
was tested on sun, hp, and sgi. Some precompiled
xhdvi binaries can also be found on <a href="/help/CTANservers.html">CTAN</a>.
<li>A compiled version of TeXview.app, the nExtstep dvi previewer
augmented for hypertex, was originally provided by
Dmitri Linde (dmitri@physics.stanford.edu [also the author of
InstantTeX.app]). 
<!--This version (dating from the summer of 1994) is <a
href="HyperTeXview.tar.gz">HyperTeXview 1.0beta3</a>
(also available via anonymous ftp from xxx.lanl.gov as
<a href="ftp://xxx.lanl.gov/pub/hypertex/HyperTeXview.tar.gz">/pub/hypertex/HyperTeXview.tar.gz</a>).-->
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/doyle/doyle.html">Mark 
Doyle</a> has significantly extended Dmitri's original version with the
addition of multiple views and multiple documents. The <a
href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/doyle/HyperTeXview/README_HTA.txt">README</a>
gives a more complete overview of the current features and known bugs.
The latest binary (as of 12 May 1996) is available at 
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/doyle/HyperTeXview/HyperTeXview.tar.gz">
HyperTeXview0.1beta1</a> or via ftp at 
<a href="ftp://gita.lanl.gov/people/doyle/HyperTeXview/HyperTeXview.tar.gz">
this URL</a>. NeXT TeX users might also be interested in <a href=
"http://www.nmr.embl-heidelberg.de/eduStep/Subjects/Publishing/Projects/Projects.html">NeXTTeX
2000</a>. HyperTeXview is also part of the teTeX distribution for NeXTSTEP,
thanks to Gregor Hoffleit (who has also added support for kpathsearch).

</ul>
(There are still some known minor <a href="bugs.html">bugs</a> and desired
enhancements for the above two.)

<h3><a name="pdf">pdf</a></h3>
Adobe has implemented a modification of Postscript called Acrobat
(with file extension .pdf = portable document format). It is essentially
a version of uuencoded compressed postscript with a full hyperlink overlay.
(There are now .pdf viewers for Unix, pc Windows, and Macintosh; though
some still in beta, available via anonymous ftp from
<a href="ftp://ftp.adobe.com/pub/adobe/Applications/Acrobat/">ftp.adobe.com</a>) 
In addition, pdf files are <i>searchable and indexable</i>. The 
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/doyle/README_HPS.txt">dvihps driver</a>
(generalizing dvips in the obvious way --- N.B. support for the HyperTeX
specials has finally been merged into the main dvips distribution, as of 
dvips5.60a --thanks to Tom Rokicki)
allows passing the hypertext information from the .dvi to the .ps file
in the form of pdf marks that are picked up by the Acrobat distiller,
giving a most powerful method for producing automatically hyperlinked .pdf.
(Then the relation of hyper .dvi to hyper .ps or .pdf is the same as is
currently the relation between .dvi and .ps; with ultimate translation to
hyper .ps or .pdf giving a more portable final hyperlinked format.)  Indeed
this was the original motivation for hypertex -- when I saw Acrobat Exchange
demo'ed in fall '93, it seemed auspicious to have all of the hyperlink
capability but horrifying to contemplate armies of people adding hyperlink
overlays "by hand" after the fact, especially when much of the contextual
structure is already present in the .tex source, only to be lost in the
conversion to .dvi then e.g. to postscript. 
We decided then that \special's were the natural means to pass this
structure out from the .tex source to be picked up from the .dvi level
by subsequent drivers. (For some updated comments on pdf [10/94], see
this <a href="pdfcomments.txt">mail message</a>.) As of 7/96, we now offer
papers in pdf. See our
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/faq/pdffaq.html"> pdf faq </a>.

<h2><a name="hyperps">hyperPS</a> and hyperhacked Ghostview</h2>

For information on the above mentioned modified dvips driver (written by
Mark Doyle) that picks up the embedded hyperlink info from the .dvi file,
see this
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/doyle/README_HPS.txt">README_HPS</a>.
<p>
For information on a modified version of ghostview (written by Tanmoy
Bhattacharya) that interprets the embedded hyperPS commands (i.e. without
necessity of passing to Adobe's ps -> pdf distiller), see this
<a
href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/README-ghostview-mods.html">README-ghosthview</a>.
Note that the next version of ghostscript (now undergoing beta testing
[6/95]) will incorporate this functionality.

<h2>But wait, there's <a name="more">more...</a></h2>
Since latex and other standard macropackages are already highly structured,
by simple modification of the underlying macros it is possible to add
extensive hypertext capabilities to <i>pre-existing</i> .tex source
(i.e., for equations, figures, references, pagenumbers, etc.).
Moreover these macro redefinitions insert standardized &lt;a name=""&gt;
anchors that allow reference to <i>third party</i> papers in standard form
(if compiled using the same macropackages), e.g. by appending
#equation.2.3, #page.7, #figure.4, #table.2, etc., to the associated URL.
<p>
<a
href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/hyperbasics.tex">hyperbasics.tex</a>
are simple low level hypertext macros (as in the example at the top of this
page), written by Tanmoy Bhattacharya (tanmoy@qcd.lanl.gov) that implement
the standard format for external reference.
They can be used directly or can be called by straightforward modifications
of existing macropackages. Tested macropackages include:
<ul>
<li><a href="lanlmac.tex">lanlmac.tex</a>:
My modified version of harvmac.tex (last updated 7/26/94),
works seamlessly to convert pre-existing harvmac-based source to hypertex
(see examples <a href="#harvsamp">below</a>).
<li>
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/hyperlatex.tex">hyperlatex.tex</a>:
(Somewhat outdated and for LaTeX 2.09 only)
For latex-based source, 
automatically upgrades latex macros to hyperlatex (install in tex/inputs
directory).
This file is input before the \documentstyle
when using LaTeX, and  will automatically cause the relevant .hty files 
(if present) to be included after the associated .sty file.
Some .hty files to install in tex/inputs (each containing modifications
to the corresponding .sty file) are:

To define a convenient hlatex format using a format (.fmt) file, use
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/hlatex.tex">hlatex.tex</a>
to generate hlatex.fmt
(e.g. on unix systems, use: <code>initex \&latex hlatex.tex</code>)
and install in tex/formats directory.
This format will automatically \input hyperlatex at the
beginning of all documents. Command line use of hlatex.fmt 
is system dependent: on unix systems, 
create a link (e.g. <code>ln -s latex hlatex</code>), then the command
<code>hlatex file</code> replaces <code>latex file</code>
to produce automatic hyperlatex.

<h2><a name="examples">Example .dvi files</a></h2>
It has been an impressive exercise to grab files from the e-print archives
and hypertex them using the above modified macros. 
All examples have essentially "just worked". Here are a few example files:
<ul>
<li><a href="hharvsamp.dvi" name="harvsamp">harvsamp.dvi</a> : 
A sample file illustrating the modified harvmac macros,
with source <a href="hharvsamp.tex">harvsamp.tex</a>.
<li>
<a href="hyperlh88.tar.gz">hyperlh88.tar.gz</a>: by popular demand,
dvi file plus figures for my 1988 Les Houches lectures
"Applied Conformal Field Theory" (266kb .gz file gunzips to 911kb).
Good example of pre-existing source that painlessly retexs with new macros
(harvmac/lanlmac) into much more functional form with large numbers of
internal links to sections, subsections, eqns, refs, figs, etc.
<li>
<a href="hypertasi92.tar.gz">hypertasi92.tar.gz</a>: dvi file plus figures
from hep-th/9304011 [<a href="/abs/hep-th/9304011">abs</a>], 200 page
set of lecture notes using harvmac/lanlmac. (note that 392kb .gz
file gunzips to 1.6Mb -- but worthwhile as another impressive example of
pre-existing source that automatically recompiles with <i>thousands</i> of
internal linkages [couldn't be faked...].)
<li>
<a href="emdual.tar.gz">emdual.tar.gz</a> dvi plus two figures from
hep-th/9407087 [<a href="/abs/hep-th/9407087">abs</a>], a random
paper (just received, by Seiberg and Witten) that also uses harvmac.
<li>
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/examples/ambjorn.dvi">ambjorn.dvi</a>:
The dvi file from hep-lat/9405022 [<a href="/abs/hep-lat/9405022">abs</a>],
an example file from the e-print archives using latex (article style).
<li><a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/examples/Anomalkap.dvi">anomalkap.dvi</a>: The dvi file from hep-lat/9309014
[<a href="/abs/hep-lat/9309014">abs</a>], an example file from
the e-print archives using revtex.
</ul>

Some more examples of hyperdvi files can be found in
tanmoy's  <A HREF="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hyperdvi/">hyperdvi</A>
directory. These files are mainly documentation about TeX, automatically
generated from the web files. He has also made available
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/hyperwebmac.tex">hyperwebmac.tex</a> 
(modified version of webmac.tex that is used to process .tex generated from
.web by weave),
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/hypercwebmac.tex">hypercwebmac.tex</a> 
(modified version of cwebmac.tex [version 2.1] that is used to process .tex
generated from .w by cweave), and
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/hyperncwebmac.tex">hyperncwebmac.tex</a> 
(same as above for cwebmac.tex version 3.0).
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/LaTeX2e.conf">LaTeX2e.conf</a>
is (untested) contributed software or latex2e users.

<h2><a name="external">External and relative URL's</a></h2>

The above macros are set up to generate automatically only 
linkages internal to files.  
External URL's can easily be added by hand (as in the 
<a href="#burble">example</a> at the top of this page), others
could be added automatically (e.g. references to arch-ive/papernum
could easily be parsed to 
&lt;a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/e-print/arch-ive/papernum"&gt; ).
Eventually various conventions used in writing will change (e.g. 
figures will typically be small thumbnail images linked to external
viewers, and similarly for other resources; and the text itself will
be restructured to take advantage of branched exposition).
<p>
Currently the nExtstep HyperTeXview.app is set up to message external
URL's to OmniWeb.app (soon will support 
<a href="http://sente.epfl.ch/~swoman/">SpiderWoman</a>, the first browser
to support base/relative URL pairs), and
works well for absolute URL's under NS3.2 (uses the "open URL" service exported
by OmniWeb, some examples inserted in <a href="#harvsamp">harvsamp</a>).
On X, messaging from xhdvi to e.g. Mosaic can be implemented using the
primitive Mosaic
"<a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/remote-control.html">remote
control</a>"  (xhdvi calls the executable specified by the 
environment variable $WWWBROWSER on any URL it does not understand).
An implementation for opening e.g. external dvi files from within dvi
files exists (see 
<a href="http://nqcd.lanl.gov/people/tanmoy/hypertex/X/">xhdvi/mosaic</a> on nqcd),
but needs simplification pending improved www client capabilities.
<p>
It is clearly silly to reproduce html transport capabilities within .dvi
(or .pdf) viewers, but the current generation of www clients does not
allow very sophisticated in/out messaging. Ideally, 
when a www client opens a .dvi (or .pdf) viewer on a file, it should
pass a "base URL" to the viewer. When the viewer encounters a relative
URL, it should be able to message its base URL together with the relative
URL back to the www client which will parse and retrieve.
Currently, however, www clients such as Mosaic for X allow neither passing
a URL to an external browser nor sophisticated messaging back. It is hoped
that the next generation of www clients will separate the html transport
from the html viewing and allow more generalized messaging to/from the
transport object. (Perhaps this is a job for the 
"<a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/Organization/Consortium/W3OSignature.html">WWW
consortium</a>".)
<p>
For the time being, however, use of absolute URL's still provides
impressive hypertex functionality.
<h2><a name="added">Additional clarifying comments</a></h2>
In answer to some early questions raised, the following
comments are paraphrased
From: asmith@bigsky.chem.washington.edu (Arthur Smith),
Date: Wed, 27 Jul 94 00:14:07 -0700 :
<p>
Note that hypertex is not intended as a replacement to HTML,
nor are the viewers intended as a replacement to Mosaic or 
other www browser ---
it is intended more to represent an early generation of 
alternative document viewer with closer ties to the Web
(somewhat along the lines of the ghostscript or xv viewers currently used,
but with the added benefit of hypertext within the TeX/dvi/pdf
documents themselves).
<p>
The advantages are: no need for complex conversions of pre-existing
TeX files into HTML, and no need to wait for a future version of html
with support for equations. In addition, the macro capabilities of TeX
allow hypertext to be created with little or no effort on the part
of the author. It is anticipated that this will be ideal for
scientists and mathematicians who already use TeX. 
We hope that the tools will be sufficiently popular to motivate
improvements that may allow TeX documents (whether in dvi format or pdf) to
be tied even more closely to the Web than is possible with our first
generation set of tools. They are now at least sufficiently
usable to allow a single line change of a TeX file to create
the hyperdvi files on the server side, a single
button click on a Web browser to bring up a hyperdvi document, and
with a little more initial effort on the author's side, a single button
click in the dvi viewer on the reader's side to bring up related documents.
