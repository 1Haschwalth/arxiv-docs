<div class="abstract">
HyperTeX is a defacto standard for inclusion of hyperlink information
in TeX and LaTeX documents, which can then be used to generated PDF or
DVI files with embedded links. These links enable easy navigation
inside documents as well as between documents, just as in HTML, using
standard PDF, Postscript and DVI viewers. Various TeX, LaTeX and BibTeX style
sheets and macro packages exist which facilitate the construction of hyperlinked
documents.
</div>

<h2>Adding hyperlinks to a LaTeX document</h2>
<div class="answer">
The simplest way to add hyperlinks to a LaTeX document is to make use
of
the <a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/macros/latex2e/contrib/hyperref/">hyperref</a>
package written by Sebastian Rahtz. It provides macros for
constructing hyperlinks by hand, and it can also automatically
construct hyperlinks for all the '<tt>\cite</tt>' and '<tt>\ref</tt>'
commands. Hyperref is part of most modern TeX distributions.

To use it, simply add
<code class="texfrag">\usepackage{hyperref}
</code>
to the top of your LaTeX file. See below for a <a href="#example">more
  detailed example</a>.

You will also want to read the section below in order to find out how
to make the PDF, Postscript or DVI file.
</div>
<div class="answer">
Plain TeX users are referred to the
<a href="ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/support/hypertex/tanmoy/hyperbasics.tex">hyperbasics.tex</a>
file written by Tanmoy Bhattacharya.
</div>

<h2>Generating PDF/Postscript/DVI files with hyperlinks</h2>
<div class="answer">
If you use hyperref, the DVI file which comes out of latex will
contain hyperlink information which is recognised by programs such as
xdvi. 
</div>
<div class="answer">
In order to create a Postscript or PDF file, you need to use the a
hyperlink-aware converter such
as <a href="http://www.radicaleye.com/dvips.html">dvips</a>, 
<a href="http://gaspra.kettering.edu/dvipdfm/">dvipdfm</a>, or generate the PDF file
  directly from the TeX or LaTeX source using 
<a href="http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/">pdftex</a>.
</div>

<h2>Viewing TeX/LaTeX generated output with hyperlinks</h2>
<div class="answer">
Most DVI previewers, such as <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~vojta/xdvi.html">xdvi</a>,
<a href="http://akagi.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ftp.html#TeX">dviout</a> and 
<a href="http://www.geom.umn.edu/java/idvi/">idvi</a> will display
hypertex links without any further modifications.
</div>
<div class="answer">
The same is true for most PDF previewers, such as
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.html">Adobe
  Reader</a>, recent versions of <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/">Evince</a> and
<a href="http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/">Xpdf</a>.
</div>
<div class="answer">
Finally, there exist a few Postscript previewers which can handle the
hypertex links. These
include <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/">GSview</a> and
<a href="http://arXiv.org/hypertex/sources/hyper-gs/">HyperHacked Ghostview</a>.
</div>

<h2>Using BibTeX with hyperlinks</h2>
<div class="answer">
There are various BibTeX style files which automatically create
hyperlinks to eprints available
through <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a>. BibTeX entries which are
compatible with these styles are generated by SPIRES, and look like
<code class="texfrag">@Article{Maldacena:1997re,
     author        = "Maldacena, Juan Martin",
     title         = "{The large N limit of superconformal field theories and
                      supergravity}",
     journal       = "Adv. Theor. Math. Phys.",
     volume        = "2",
     year          = "1998",
     pages         = "231-252",
     eprint        = "hep-th/9711200",
     archivePrefix = "arXiv",
     SLACcitation  = "%%CITATION = HEP-TH/9711200;%%"
}
</code>
Style files which handle both the old-style and new-style preprint
numbers include <a href="http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/TeXstuff/utphys.bst">utphys.bst</a>
and <a href="bibstyles/kp.bst">kp.bst</a>. For more information
see <a href="bibstyles/">the BibTeX page on arXiv.org</a>.
</div>

<h2>Example</h2>
<a name="example"/>
<div class="answer">
(For full details you are referred to the
<a href="http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/ftp/doc/manual.html">manual
  of hyperref</a>.)
Here is a sample LaTeX file which includes links:
<code class="texfrag">\documentclass[11pt]{article}
\usepackage{hyperref}

\begin{document}
This is the first page, with a 
\hyperlink{page2}{link to a word on the second page}.

\newpage

This is the \hypertarget{page2}{second} page, with a link to an
\href{http://www.arxiv.org}{external document}.

\end{document}
</code>
If you now run
<code class="texfrag">latex link.tex
dvips -z link.dvi -o link.ps
ps2pdf link.ps link.pdf
</code>
you will end up with <a href="link.dvi">link.dvi</a>, <a href="link.ps">link.ps</a> and
<a href="link.pdf">link.pdf</a> files which all contain
hyperlinks. Alternatively, you can use pdflatex,
<code class="texfrag">pdflatex link.tex
</code>
to obtain the hyperlinked PDF file directly.

There is a wide variety of options to influence the link style 
</div>


<h2>How it is all done internally</h2>
<div class="answer">
TeX and LaTeX output is in the form of a ".dvi" file, the letters
being short for "device-independent". ".dvi" files are not completely
self-contained because they depend on external font files, but aside
from that they describe the formatting of a document in a fashion
independent of the display or printing device.  The ".dvi" format is
also arbitrarily extendible, due to the "\special" command of TeX,
which allows new display commands to be embedded in the ".dvi" file.
The "\special" command has previously been used to extend TeX by
allowing inclusion of line drawings, PostScript figures, and colored
text.
</div>
<div class="answer">
HyperTeX adds five new "\special" commands to the menagerie. These
are:
<code class="texfrag">\special{html:&lt;a href="hrefstring"&gt;}
\special{html:&lt;a name="namestring"&gt;}
\special{html:&lt;/a&gt;}
\special{html:&lt;img src="hrefstring"&gt;}
\special{html:&lt;base href="hrefstring"&gt;}</code>
These are identified as HyperTeX specials by the first 4 characters,
"html". The first three commands establish links between sections of
documents in a manner exactly analogous to the HTML of the WWW. The
"img" command is intended to place an image of arbitrary graphical
format on the page, although this is not very widely supported by
current viewers.  The "hrefstring" values are arbitrary URLs. If you
want to use a fragment indicator in the URL (the `#' hash mark), make
sure to change its catcode to `letter' first:
<code class="texfrag">{\catcode`\#=11
\special{html:&lt;a href="http://www.foo.org/bar#foobar"}}</code>
See chapter 7 of the TeXbook for more information about catcodes.
</div>
<div class="answer">
Rather than just applying these "\special" commands directly, use of
one of the macro packages (at least as a first
step to "hyper-izing" a document) is highly recommended.
</div>
<div class="answer">
The various subsections of a document can be referenced as part of a
URL description through the "#" extension to the URL name. We have
been using the following standard names for ease of linking into
HyperTeX documents based on the macro packages currently available:
<code class="texfrag">Page 5 is at             doc.dvi#page.5
Section 2 is at          doc.dvi#section.2
Equation 3 is at         doc.dvi#equation.3
Reference 11 is at       doc.dvi#reference.11</code>
(but see the note about `#' catcodes in the previous section).
Similar definitions thus far exist for subsection, figure and table
entities. New macro packages or style files should try to conform to
this naming scheme (see the currently available packages for details
on how this is done).
