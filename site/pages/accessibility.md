# Web Accessibility

**The arXiv.org web site is designed to work on the largest possible set of browsers and platforms, and to be accessible to users with disabilities.**

Our web pages are valid [XHTML 1.0 Transitional](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2F) and valid [CSS 2.0](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=http%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2F&usermedium=all). We are working to generate XHTML _Strict_, which will provide some usability improvements over XTHML Transitional. Note that we do not correct or validate HTML submissions, so they may contain malformed HTML expressions.

Valid XHTML and CSS allow arXiv.org web pages to render well on modern browsers and degrade gracefully in older and less robust browsers. Furthermore, we follow the W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WAI-WEBCONTENT-19990505/) and comply with [Section 508](http://www.section508.gov) of the US Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to be accessible to user with disabilities.

## The December 2005 Redesign

As of December, 2005, almost all arXiv.org readers used browsers that support XHTML and CSS. Browser usage was as follows:


|Browser   |Percentage of users|
|----------|-------------------|
|Internet Explorer 5.0 and later|40%|
|Firefox 1.0 and later|22%|
|Mozilla and Netscape 5.0 and later|14%|
|Safari|10%|
|Other browsers and RSS readers|14%|


Our goals in the redesign were to increase the usability and aesthetics of arXiv.org, and for the main site to comply with [Cornell Visual Identity guidelines](https://brand.cornell.edu/).

By using XHTML and CSS, we aim for arXiv.org pages to render identically on modern, standards-compliant browsers (namely Internet Explorer, Firefox, Mozilla, and Safari). Furthermore, pages should degrade gracefully in older and non-standard browsers, so that page elements are visible and legible in all browsers.
