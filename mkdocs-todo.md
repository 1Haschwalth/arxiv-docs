# TODO for migration to mkdocs

### TODO Review content and nav 
- Problem [/about/ourmembers.html](about/ourmembers.md) Top 100 and others a bit strange due to custom styles (DONE)

- Very broken due to custom jinja code [/about/people/leadership_team.html](about/people/leadership_team.md) (DONE)

- Support confirm and membership confirm seems like duplicates? (I think they are different. Left as is)

- Our supporters and our members seem like duplicates? (left as is. Will tackle this question with Jim and Alison during future planned content rehaul)

- Get rid of User testing api email form? (Kept for now)

- marxdown redirect pages:
  [/help/announcement.html](help/announcement.md) 
  [/help/submit_html.html](help/submit_html.md) 


- User testing api and user testing group seem very similar? (Kept both, they are unique use cases. Differentiated title more)

- [/about/reports/whitepaper.html ](/about/reports/whitepaper.html ) could use a better name  (DONE)

- No content on these pages:  (DONE. removed empty pages below, + others as found)
[/help/donate.html](help/donate.md) 
[/help/general.html](help/general.md) 
[/help/primer.html](help/primer.md) 
[/help/submission-policy.html](help/submission-policy.md) 
[/help/support.html](help/support.md) 
[/help/terms_of_submission.html](help/terms_of_submission.md) 
[/help/toc.html](help/toc.md) 

- [/help/whytex.html](help/whytex.md) fix link to [/help/textures](help/faq/textures.md)  (DONE)

- Broken images on [/help/withdraw.html](help/withdraw.md) (DONE)

- very broken: [/labs/showcase.html](labs/showcase.md) (DONE)

- Remove GZip help (DONE)

- Remove my.arxiv.org page. my.arxiv.org no longer exists  (DONE)
[/help/my_arxiv.html](help/my_arxiv.md)

- Images broken on [/help/orcid.html](help/orcid.md) (DONE)

- Are we trying to get TeX on this page on the subject heading "Notes on Note on La$\TeX$ accent commands" ? [/help/prep.html](help/prep.md) (I think it is correct so left as is. But pending feedback from Jake or Jim)

- Can probably get rid of this page: [/help/ssl.html](help/ssl.md) It's old news and standard practice.  (DONE)

- [/help/submit_index.html](help/submit_index.md) needs better title.  (DONE)
