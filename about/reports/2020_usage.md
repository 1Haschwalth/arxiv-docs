**Caveats**: While we have made considerable effort to extract reliable data, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include but are not limited to the following:
1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete;
2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads;
3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and
4) for institutional downloads, we include only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize. Clients with host names that don't resolve or have off-campus access will not be recognized and lead to undercounts. Downloads from commercial ISPs are not included in the above.
5) institutional submission counts may be affected by disambiguation issues.
