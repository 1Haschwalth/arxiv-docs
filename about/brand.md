# arXiv's Brand and Identity

arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science. 

We aim to cultivate an identity that reflects arXiv’s true nature as a professional, innovative tool created by and for researchers. arXiv’s brand guide and usage guidelines ensure that we express arXiv's identity with consistent quality and continuity across communication channels, and protect it from unauthorized usage that causes confusion among our community of users.
