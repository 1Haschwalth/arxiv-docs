# arXiv Business Support and Governance Model

Operations are maintained by the arXiv Leadership Team and arXiv staff at Cornell, with the help of numerous volunteer subject moderators. Governance of arXiv is led by the Leadership Team with guidance from the [arXiv Scientific Advisory Board](/about/people/scientific_ad_board) and the [arXiv Member Advisory Board](/about/people/member_ad_board). The [Technical Advisory Group](/about/people/technical_ad_group) provides technical advice to the IT Team.
