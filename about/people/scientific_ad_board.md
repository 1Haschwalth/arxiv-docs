arXiv's Scientific Advisory Board is composed of scientists and researchers in disciplines covered by arXiv. The Board provides advice and guidance pertaining to the repository's intellectual oversight, with a particular focus on the policies and operation of arXiv's moderation system. The Board is governed by [Bylaws](/about/sab_bylaws) that detail its duties, composition, and operation as well as the election of its members.
