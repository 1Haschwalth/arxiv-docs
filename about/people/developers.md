# Volunteer Developers

The technical infrastructure and software behind arXiv.org is operated and
maintained by a core team of dedicated IT staff at Cornell. However, it would
not be possible to keep pace with the ever-changing landscape of internet
technology, nor the evolving needs of 21st century science, without the help of
dedicated arXiv users who contribute to the open source software that powers
the arXiv platform.

We are grateful to the following external developers for their contributions to the arXiv codebase:

- Takeo Imai ([bonotake](https://github.com/bonotake))
- Warren Price ([warpri81](https://github.com/warpri81))
- John Cook ([johncookds](https://github.com/johncookds))
- Darien Yeung ([Yeungdb](https://github.com/Yeungdb))
- Sawood Alam ([ibnesayeed](https://github.com/ibnesayeed))
- Adhitya Mohan ([poad42](https://github.com/poad42))
- Tanvi Anand ([tanvi15](https://github.com/tanvi15))
