arXiv is an indispensable tool for the scientific community. Nevertheless it can be difficult to describe. These brand pillars drive our messaging.

Over the past 30 years arXiv has radically changed the way scientists interact with each other and do their research. The movement arXiv began is now an established part of the communications landscape, but arXiv has more to offer than low cost, instantaneous dissemination of articles: human *collaboration on a global scale*, sharing of *interactive data* and results, unique resolvable *records that evolve with time*, and much more. arXiv is committed to continue its success in leading innovation in scientific information sharing.

##Vision
Our vision is for all researchers around the world to have immediate, free and open access to all established and emerging research in their field.

##Core Value
Our core value can be summed up in just two words:

*arXiv Connects*

arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.

> “arXiv is often the first place where researchers take action in open science.”
> —Dr. Hideaki Takeda, Professor, National Institute of Informatics

This core value is reflected across arXiv's brand, from the intertwining arms of the chi in our logo, to our tagline, to our typographic treatments, tone of voice, and messaging. The world has changed since arXiv was created in 1991, but throughout these changes arXiv remains your connection to open science.

##Passion for science
As a truly global organization, our community reaches all continents. We strongly believe that science is for everyone, and arXiv is committed to provide access to knowledge to everyone: no matter their country, gender, race or background. To prosper, science needs expertise, diverse ideas and the scientific method. arXiv brings these ingredients together without prejudice or fear

##We are a community
arXiv works thanks to a small staff and a very large, engaged, global community. Our institutional members, collaborators, moderators, authors, and readers are not passive recipients of arXiv’s services -- they are arXiv. We value our community, and we strive to respond to its needs by cultivating meaningful relationships and creating opportunities for collaborative innovation.

##Priorities
These are the primary messages we send to convey our priorities:
- arXiv is rock solid. arXiv’s strong technical, funding, and governance foundation reliably provides readers and authors an integral gateway to open science, all year long, across the globe. A significant part of this strength is drawn from our relationships with people and organizations in research and scholarly communications.
- Our value to authors is clear: more than 2 million articles contributed, and more than 2 billion downloads. Countless discoveries, connections, and synergies have been catalyzed in arXiv’s 30+ year history.
- We’re primed for growth and innovation. Ideas abound, and we have the structures and systems in place to prioritize and execute high impact innovation.
