#Images
arXiv's branding uses both photographs and illustrations. Photos are used alone or paired with our [tagline](tagline.html). Illustrations capture abstract concepts well and are used in presentations and documentation.

> **Important: Images may only be used for arXiv-owned materials.** All assets within arXiv image libraries have been cleared for use in arXiv materials. Use in materials outside of arXiv is not covered by copyright.

##Photos
[Go to the arXiv Photo Library](https://cornell.box.com/v/arXiv-photo-library)

Photographs are an important part of the arXiv visual brand. Our curated photo collection represent academic spaces, researchers, labs, and other research-related subject matter. Images of the Cornell and Cornell Tech campuses help create a sense of place, and portraiture humanizes the vast community of people who rely on arXiv.

We apply color washes to photos in our [brand colors](colors.html).

Photographs can be overlayed with a [tagline](tagline.html) as shown here.

##Illustrations
[Go to the arXiv Illustration library](https://cornell.box.com/v/arXiv-illustration-library)

Illustrations are used to represent abstract concepts or stakeholder groups. The illustrative style we use is informal and friendly. It is not slick or polished, but emphasizes thrift and mission focus, with a touch of gentle humor.
