Passwords in arXiv
==================

arXiv uses two types of passwords:

-   User account passwords for accessing your user account page
    ([https://arxiv.org/user](https://arxiv.org/user))
-   Paper passwords for claiming ownership of a paper submitted by
    co-authors or a proxy

User account passwords:
-----------------------

-   Details about setting up your account are on our [registration help
    page.](/help/registerhelp.md)
-   If you forgot your user account password, please see the [lost
    password form](https://arxiv.org/user/lost_password).
-   If you need help recovering an arXiv user account, please email
    help@arxiv.org.

Paper passwords:
----------------

arXiv now maintains [authority records](/help/authority.md). For any given
paper, arXiv keeps a list of people who are authorized to make changes
(these are referred to as **paper owners**). When a paper is first
submitted to arXiv, the submitter is the one and only owner of the
paper. See [authority records](https://arxiv.org/help/authority) for
more information.
