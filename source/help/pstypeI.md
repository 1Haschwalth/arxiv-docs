PostScript with Type I (scalable) fonts
---------------------------------------

Scalable Type I or Type 1 (variously written with a Latin and Roman one)
fonts contain explicit PostScript instructions for drawing each
character, rather than a bitmap of the result. They are always rendered
at the correct resolution for whatever device you are using to view or
print the PostScript.

To view and print PostScript with Type 1 fonts you will need to have the
correct fonts installed on your local system. We have notes on setting
up [Type 1 PostScript fonts on Linux](type1linux).

Note that there are several versions of the Type 1 Computer Modern fonts
used by TeX, and they use different naming conventions. For instance,
the public domain Bakoma fonts use a lowercase "cm" in their naming
scheme, while some of the commercial fonts suppliers use an uppercase
"CM". You can select which naming convention your installation uses. For
more information on the different Type I fonts available, see our
[Discussion on Computer Modern PostScript Fonts](/help/pscm).
