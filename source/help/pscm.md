# PostScript Fonts

Computer Modern Postscript Fonts in Adobe Type I Format are device-independent and
resolution-independent outline fonts for use in Postscript documents.
There are four sets of Type I fonts of interest to users of the archives
and TeX users in general. These are the Bakoma, Blue-Sky, AMSFonts, and
Paradissa font sets. Depending on your software, they may also display
much better than traditional bitmap fonts (give them a try).

Scalable Type I or Type 1 (variously written with a Latin and Roman one)
fonts contain explicit PostScript instructions for drawing each
character, rather than a bitmap of the result. They are always rendered
at the correct resolution for whatever device you are using to view or
print the PostScript.

To view and print PostScript with Type 1 fonts you will need to have the
correct fonts installed on your local system. We have notes on setting
up [Type 1 PostScript fonts on Linux](type1linux.md).

The Bakoma fonts are a version of Computer Modern (the standard TeX
font) which have been freely available for some time. The Blue-Sky fonts
are a version of Computer Modern which were made freely available in
early 1997. See [the
discussion](http://www.ams.org/tex/type1-cm-fonts.html) on the AMS
server for more information on the Blue-Sky font deal.

The Paradissa fonts are extra fonts, including the AMS fonts and some
Cyrillic fonts. The AMSFonts set includes the Euler, "extra symbol" and
cyrillic fonts in selected sizes; these were produced by Blue Sky
Research and made freely available in late 1997. See the [the
discussion](http://www.ams.org/tex/type1-cm-fonts.html) on the AMS
server and the [AMS ftp site](ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/psfonts/ams/)
for the AMSFonts.

What's the difference between Bakoma and Blue-Sky?
--------------------------------------------------

With two font sets of different origin some compatibility questions
arise, especially for documents with non-embedded fonts.

First of all, the two font sets are basically interchangeable.
Postscript or PDF documents with non-embedded fonts, which were created
based on one font set, can be displayed using either of the two font
sets.

There is a minor problem with naming conventions for case sensitive
operating systems. The Bakoma font names are all lowercase, while
Blue-Sky font names are all uppercase. If your fontfiles don't match the
font names in the Postscript or PDF file, you will have to translate the
font names in the document (note that we offer Postscript and PDF files
with a [choice of naming convention](psvariants.md); for example Macintosh
use fonts with upper case NAMES), or translate the case of your
fontfiles or make symbolic links from uppercase to lowercase names.

Blue-Sky fonts cover Knuth's 75 CM fonts (plus the extra LaTeX and
SliTeX fonts) *exactly*, but no others, while the combination of Bakoma
and Paradissa contains in addition the AMS fonts and some Cyrillic
fonts. You will need these additional fonts from Bakoma and Paradissa if
you want to read type 1 Postscript or PDF documents produced by arXiv.
You will see incorrect symbols especially in math formulas without them.

Which look better?
------------------

One thing in favor of Bakoma fonts is that they are slightly darker
(probably because of a different mode\_def setting); this is probably an
advantage since Computer Modern is a light font.

Blue-Sky fonts are said to render better on high quality rasterizers
like Adobe Type Manager (ATM), which make proper use of the "hinting"
information in the fonts. One cannot see much of a difference between
Blue-Sky and Bakoma fonts on a low quality font rasterizer.
