Translations
============

arXiv does accept translations of previously published work, if that
work has value to the scientific communities represented in arXiv.

Submitters should be aware that translations involve more complex
copyright considerations than normal research articles. arXiv submission
requires that the submitter have the right to grant arXiv a
[non-exclusive and irrevocable license](http://arxiv.org/help/license)
to distribute the submitted work. Typically, authors have the right to
grant this license because they hold copyright in their own works.
Translations, however, are derivative works, and if the source work is
still under copyright, then the translator must have the permission of
the current copyright holder of the source work before publishing a
translation.

It is the responsibility of the submitter either 1) to secure the
permission of the copyright owner, or 2) to be prepared to assert that
the original work is in the public domain everywhere in the world.

If a work was published before 1880, it is most likely in the public
domain. Research is often required to determine whether works published
after 1880 are under copyright somewhere in the world.

If at all possible, the title of the translation should include the
title of the translated work and the original author's name. For
example:

-   A translation of AUTHOR'S "TITLE"
-   A translation of "TITLE" by AUTHOR
