ScienceWISE
===========

arXiv has partnered with [ScienceWISE](http://sciencewise.info) as part
of a pilot program to provide additional services to arXiv users. These
services include user annotation of papers which are then linked from
arXiv and other social bookmarking sites.

If you are the owner of one or more papers, you have the option of
annotating your articles with ScienceWISE from your main [account
page](https://arxiv.org/user), by clicking on the respective icon:
<img src="https://arxiv.org/icons/sciencewise45x32.png" alt="ScienceWISE icon" width="32" height="23" />

You can bookmark interesting abstracts on ScienceWISE via the icon in
the bookmark section that is present on all abstract pages. Please note
that you must first [register](http://sciencewise.info/users/register)
with ScienceWISE to use this feature.

Additional information on the ScienceWISE project is available on their
[FAQ page](http://sciencewise.info/faq).
