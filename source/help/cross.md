# Crosslisting articles

## To cross-list an article to another category
You may feel that your article is of direct interest to the readers of a
category other than the one to which you submitted your article. In such
cases you may cross-list your article to the other category so that your
article appears in the regular listing for that category (in the
cross-list section).

Note that readers consider excessive or inappropriate cross-listing to
be bad etiquette, so consider your cross-lists beforehand, and do not
cross-list excessively or without good reason. It is rarely appropriate
to add more than one or two cross-lists. Also note that you are unlikely
to know that a cross-list is appropriate unless you are yourself a
reader of the archive to which you are considering a cross-list. Bad
cross-lists will be removed.

You can cross-list an article using the cross-list facility on your
[user page](http://arxiv.org/cross).
