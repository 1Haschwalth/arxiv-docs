Semantic Scholar Pilot for Computer Science Papers
==================================================

**14 Nov 2016**

arXiv is collaborating on a 12-month pilot project with the Allen
Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), making the AI-based
[semanticscholar.org](https://semanticscholar.org) search engine
available to the arXiv community. There will be search options available
in the Computer Science category, including the abstract, subject, and
CoRR (Computing Research Repository) pages, to allow users to explore
the Semantic Scholar search option. We invite feedback from users to
assess the value of this new addition to facilitate discovery of related
materials.

[AI2](http://allenai.org/) was founded in 2014 to conduct high-impact
research and engineering in the field of artificial intelligence. This
non-profit organization is founded by Paul Allen, Microsoft co-founder,
and is led by Dr. Oren Etzioni, a world-renowned AI and computer science
researcher. Semantic Scholar is an academic search engine that utilizes
artificial intelligence methods to provide highly relevant results and
novel tools to filter them with ease:
