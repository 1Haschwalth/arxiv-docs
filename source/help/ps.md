PostScript
==========

PostScript is available through our web interface, from the **ps**
links,

\[abs, src, **ps**, other\]

The **ps** link by default supplies postscript at 300 dots-per-inch
resolution. Higher resolutions and other postscript formats are
available through the **other** link.

To make efficient use of disk space and network bandwidth, our
PostScript is stored and transmitted in compressed form. We use GNU's
[gzip](gzip.md) compression.

You will need to set up your computer to uncompress the postscript
files. Well-behaved browsers uncompress files automatically, and can be
configured to call a PostScript viewer, such as Ghostview.

See [configuring your browser](config_browser.md) for help on viewing
postscript.
