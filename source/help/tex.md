# TeX, LaTeX, etc.

TeX is a text formatting and markup language developed by D. Knuth in
the late 1970s and early 1980s. It has become the defacto standard for
document preparation in mathematics and certain areas of the physical
sciences because of its unsurpassed utility in typesetting mathematical
formulae. TeX allows extension through user-provided or
third-party-provided packages of macro definitions.

LaTeX is an extension of TeX, which for purposes of discussion can be
thought of as a third-party macro package for TeX. The goal of LaTeX is
to provide a logical system for document preparation, where the author
does not have to give specific formatting instructions in order to
achieve a particular look; the look is provided by an external document
class description.

There are other variants of TeX, and many user-provided contributions.
TeX and its variants have evolved into a large and complicated suite of
document preparation tools.

A great deal of information is available on the Web. Check our detailed
utility help for [links to TeX on the Web](utilities.md#tex).

TeX and LaTeX files usually have a `.tex` extension.
