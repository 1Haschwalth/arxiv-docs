#Bulk Access Overview

arXiv is an open access research sharing platform and access to bulk data is also open, with certain stipulations. Thank you in advance for following arXivâ€™s [API Terms of Use](../../help/api/tou.md), brand guidelines, and licenses of content posted to arXiv.

The metadata options are:

- [arXiv API](../../help/api/index.md)
- [DataCite API](https://support.datacite.org/docs/api) using provider-id = arxiv
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv)

Full text options are:

- [AWS](../../help/bulk_data_s3.md) for PDF and or (La)TeX source files
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv) for PDF
- [Crawling our export service](../../help/bulk_data.md#harvest)
    - This is recommended for new content or subset of content. Otherwise the AWS or Kaggle data sets are preferred.

At this time, we do not require that commercial projects sign an MOU. We do encourage anyone who benefits financially from arXiv consider [becoming an affiliate or a sponsor](../../about/membership.md); however, doing so is completely optional.

Please do let us know when your product launches.
