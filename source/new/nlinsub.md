Mailings from the nlin archive
==============================

Submissions to the new [nlin archive](/new/nlin.md) include **Subj-class:** headings . It is possible to receive mailings of the individual subjects without subscribing to the whole archive (in fact, for subject classes of the [nlin](https://arxiv.org/archive/nlin) archive, this is the only way). No matter how many subject classes you subscribe to, all the abstracts on a given day will be mailed to you in a single message.

To subscribe to additional subject classes, or delete existing subscriptions, send a message to nlin@arXiv.org with 'subscribe' in the subject line and containing 'add' or 'del' commands in the body of the message. For example:

         To: nlin@arXiv.org
         Subject: subscribe Your Name

         add Chaotic Dynamics
         del Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems

The subject classes can be abbreviated (provided they remain unique).

The valid subject classes are listed below.

*   AO - Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems
*   CD - Chaotic Dynamics
*   CG - Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases
*   PS - Pattern Formation and Solitons
*   SI - Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems
