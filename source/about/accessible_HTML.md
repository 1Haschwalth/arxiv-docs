# HTML as an accessible format for papers

The message we have heard from our community is that arXiv can have the most impact by offering HTML alongside the existing PDF and source files. Accessible research papers is a goal within reach!

## Latest updates
The HTML papers project is in Closed Experimental stage, soon to be Public Experimental. We will be making links to HTML papers available on the live abstract pages, the list pages, and as a part of the submission process. We know at this experimental stage there will be bugs, so why not wait until it is perfect?

1. First, because our community asked us not to wait. We heard: "We need HTML now. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good."
2. And second, because we need your help identifying rendering issues. The low hanging fruit is done. We are now in the realm of identifying specific LaTeX packages that have issues and relaying that information to the NIST team behind LaTeXML, the conversion tool from LaTeX to HTML.

We invite you to provide feedback on the accessibility and accuracy of the HTML as soon as we enter the Public Experimental stage by following the simple steps below.

## How to provide feedback

- Go to the abstract page for a paper you are interested in reading.
- Look in the section where you find the link to the PDF download, and click the new link to the HTML version.
- Either click on the blue button to report issues, or use **Shift+b** to toggle accessible reporting buttons per page section.
- You can also reference a quick glossary of keyboard commands and instructions in the footer.

Please do not create reports that the HTML paper doesn't look just like the PDF paper. However, if you HTML layout that's incorrect, or just not very good, please report those. Note that we are *NOT* soliciting feedback on the content or quality of papers (that is far outside our remit).

Our goal is not to match the PDF display, and we expect the HTML papers to present differently than the same paper rendered in PDF. Line breaks will occur in different places, for example, and intricate typographic layouts will not be rendered so intricately. In general, the HTML paper won't present as compactly. This is by design. HTML is a different medium, and brings its own advantages versus PDF: aside from being much more friendly to screen readers, magnifiers, and other technologies, HTML does a far better job adapting to the characteristics of the device you're reading onâ€”whether that's your particular monitor geometry or your smartphone.

## Project collaborators
Did you know that 90% of submissions to arXiv are in TeX format, mostly LaTeX? That poses a unique accessibility challenge at arXiv: to accurately convert from TeX, a very extensible language used in myriad unique ways by authors.

We are collaborating with two organizations on this effort: The [LaTeX Project](https://www.latex-project.org/), and the [LaTeXML](https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/) team from NIST. We deeply thank each member of these teams for their knowledge, incredible work, and commitment to accessibility.

We also thank the small army of scientists with disabilities who have generously provided guidance and practical input to the project.
