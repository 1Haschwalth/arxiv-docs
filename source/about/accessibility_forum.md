## A practical forum, free and open to all
Hosted by arXiv, this half-day online forum will center the experiences of academic researchers with disabilities who face barriers to accessing and reading papers. The forum will be useful for people across the academic authoring and publishing ecosystem who are committed to making accessible research papers a reality.

**Accessible research papers is a goal within reach.** There are a lot of resources and smart people working on solutions. Together, we can chart a path towards fully accessible research papers, and leave with practical next steps for our own organizations.
