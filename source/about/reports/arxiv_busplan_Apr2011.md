arXiv Business Planning Update
------------------------------

April 2011

It has been 15 months since we announced the collaborative arXiv
business model. As we reported in our previous update, for 2010 we were
pleased to receive support from 123 institutions, totaling to \$360,000
in contributions and representing 11 countries. We are encouraged with
the contributions for 2011 as we already have support from 101
institutions, totaling to \$275,000 in pledges from 8 countries.

We are grateful for the coordinated international support from the Joint
Information Systems Committee (JISC) Collections in the UK, SPARC-Japan,
German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB),
Helmholtz-Alliance Physics (Germany), and Denmark's Electronic Research
Library (DEFF). We are currently contacting additional international
library consortia for their possible leadership in coordinating support
within some other countries.

One of the outcomes of our sustainability initiative will be the
development of a new arXiv governance structure. We currently envision
the formation of an independent Advisory Board, representative of
arXiv's key stakeholders, including researchers, libraries, and funding
agencies. We seek a structure that will provide guidance on arXiv
policy, strategic direction, and priorities, as well as independent
auditing and review. We are in the process of reviewing governance
structures of similar initiatives and services. We invite your input and
ideas, especially if you know of any successful model that we should be
considering.

As part of our sustainability planning, we took a critical look at
arXiv's technology infrastructure and prepared a high-level plan, which
includes a major change to the discovery and access component of the
platform. After having the proposal reviewed by four external colleagues
with expertise in repository architectures, we decided to implement
[Invenio](http://invenio-software.org/) as the basis of a new display
and access system. The move to Invenio will facilitate improved
collaboration with our partners at [NASA
ADS](http://adswww.harvard.edu/) and [INSPIRE](http://inspirebeta.net/),
and reduce the maintenance burden of in-house code. We anticipate the
transition, which will include a number of user interface enhancements,
to be completed by mid-2012.

We often receive questions about the feasibility of providing
submission-based statistics and comparing them with our current
institutional downloads statistics. The author metadata for arXiv is not
sufficiently consistent to support any systematic analysis but we ran
some numbers based on submitting authors' email address affiliations.
Based on sampling, we have some preliminary results, which indicate that
submission- and download-based data exhibit similar characteristics. We
continue to refine our findings and will appreciate ideas in regard to
how this information can be used for business planning purposes. As part
of the migration to Invenio, we will undertake some metadata remediation
to improve the authorship data for existing submissions. This will
enable better author linking, allow improvements in ownership claiming,
and pave the way to support author identity linking using the proposed
[ORCID](http://www.orcid.org/) author identifiers.

In collaboration with the [NSF Data Conservancy
project](http://dataconservancy.org/) we have launched a pilot data
upload interface for data associated with arXiv articles. Submission is
unified through small extensions to arXiv's submission interface. While
the article is announced and stored on arXiv, data is automatically
deposited in the Data Conservancy repository and linked from the article
(see [http://arxiv.org/help/data\_conservancy](/help/data_conservancy.md)
for more information). This is a pilot project, which will be
re-evaluated in collaboration with the Data Conservancy by the end of
this year.

As a part of our initiative, we are making an effort to closely monitor
and document expenses associated with running arXiv. The [2011
budget](None) includes an in-kind contributions
category to factor in a range of undocumented costs, such as indirect
expenses associated with housing arXiv at Cornell.

We hope that our updates are keeping you informed of the developments.
In order to respond to your questions and get your input, we will hold
three conference calls and invite you to join one:

May 6, 11am EST  
May 9, 4pm EST  
May 13, 9:30am EST

We are very interested in understanding different perspectives on our
business model efforts and welcome suggestions, criticisms, and
encouragement! Please register at
