arXiv Business Planning Update
------------------------------

December 2010

Since announcing our collaborative business model in January 2010, we
have secured pledges from 123 institutions, totaling to $360,000 in
contributions and representing 11 countries. We are especially grateful
for the assistance of the German National Library of Science and
Technology (TIB) and the Helmholtz-Alliance Physics at the Terascale in
raising the contributions for the universities and to the
Helmholtz-Society for raising the contributions for their research
centers in Germany for 2010. TIB and the Helmholtz-Society will also
coordinate the contributions for the universities and the
Helmholtz-Research Centers for 2011-2012.

As part of our sustainability planning, we have taken a critical look at
arXiv's technology infrastructure and prepared a high-level plan, which
includes a major change to the discovery and access component of the
platform. We shared the plan with four external colleagues with
expertise in repository architectures in order to solicit their input.
We are in the process of gathering feedback to assess the technology
plan.

The [arXiv Sustainability Advisory
Group](/about/reports/sustainability_advisory_group.md) held its first
meeting and discussed a range of issues including the 2011 budget and
contribution levels. As described in the [arXiv business model white
paper](/about/reports/whitepaper.md), Cornell University Library is
committed to fund 15% of the operating budget. Any potential surplus
accrued through institutional contributions will be rolled over for
future years' budget. We updated the [2010 arXiv
budget](None) and also posted a [projected budget
for 2011](None). One of our goals for the next year
is to track cost elements even closer and expand the in-kind expenses
category.

Also included in the arXiv sustainability advisory group agenda were
strategies for balancing stability and innovation of the service,
collaboration models with publishers and societies in involving them in
the business planning process, and usage statistics needs to support the
sustainability initiative. We are grateful for the input from the
advisory group, which serves an essential consultative role in assisting
Cornell develop diverse sustainability strategies.

is available at [http://arxiv.org/help/support](/help/support.md).

We thank all our [supporters](/about/reports/2010_supporters.md) and welcome
questions and suggestions.
