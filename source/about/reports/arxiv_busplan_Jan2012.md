arXiv Business Planning Update
------------------------------

January 2012

**Governance Planning Grant from Simons Foundation**

As announced in our [October'11
update](arxiv_busplan_Oct2011.md), the Simons Foundation has
provided a $60,000 planning grant to support the development of a
governance model that will guide arXiv's transition from an exclusive
initiative of Cornell University Library (CUL) to a collaboratively
governed, community supported resource. To discuss how to achieve this
goal, we will hold two planning meetings in February 2012—one in the US
and a second in Europe—with representatives from the library and science
communities. During the planning meetings, we will seek advice on
arXiv's organizational structure and operating principles. We will also
discuss a collaborative business model that continues to engage the
libraries and research labs. The planning grant will be carried out
between September 2011 and April 2012. We will share the outcomes of
these meetings and make an effort to gather broader input during March
2012.

**News from the Operations Front**

We continue working with CERN to migrate arXiv to use the
[Invenio](http://invenio-software.org/) platform for our discovery and
access interface. The decision to adopt Invenio was the result of a
critical look at arXiv's technology infrastructure, undertaken last year
as part of our overall sustainability planning. The move to Invenio will
facilitate improved collaboration with our partners at [NASA
ADS](http://adswww.harvard.edu/) and [INSPIRE](http://inspirehep.net/),
and reduce the maintenance burden of in-house code. In the coming year,
we expect to expand our programming staff by 0.5 FTE in order to assist
with this effort and other current needs. We now anticipate the
transition to Invenio, which will include a number of user interface
enhancements, to be completed in the first half of 2013. This timeline
has been revised outward by 6 months because of unforeseen difficulties
in migration and to coordinate with the Invenio team's development
schedule.

On the user support side, our work with Paul Ginsparg to transition his
moderation oversight role into regular arXiv administration processes
managed by the Library was set back somewhat by the loss of Thorsten
Schwander, who accepted a new position at CERN as the manager of
INSPIRE. Thorsten has worked with arXiv for over fifteen years,
maintaining and improving the TeX system much of that time, as well as
working on the arXiv API and the SWORD deposit interface. Since
mid-2011, Thorsten has relieved Paul Ginsparg of many routine oversight
activities, which has helped the Library better understand those
activities and how to transition them into the Library's arXiv
operations. Thorsten's departure has required that we augment our user
support staffing, and we are now seeking to fill a new position. The
arXiv Senior Administrator will oversee and manage the daily user
support and moderation activities associated with the administration of
arXiv.

**Institutional Contributions Update**

In 2011, 133 institutions in 18 countries have pledged their support,
totaling $424,000 in contributions. We gratefully acknowledge the
contributions of supporting institutions: [arXiv 2010
Supporters](2010_supporters.md) and [arXiv 2011
Supporters](2011_supporters.md). The budget information for
arXiv is available here: [CY2010 expenses and
revenues](http://tinyurl.com/3wu56ur), [CY2011 expenses and
revenues](http://tinyurl.com/7qvkt4n).

We have a [budget estimate for 2012](2012_CY_arXiv_budget.pdf) up on
the arXiv website. You will notice that the annual expenses have
increased due to our need to add a new user support person and a
half-time programmer. We have just completed performing an analysis of
the [2011 download activity](2011_usage.md) in order to
determine the top 200 constituents. There are not any significant
variations between the 2010 and 2011. Next week, we will contact each
institution on the list (or their representative) regarding 2012
support. As a new feature, we will provide a breakdown of institutional
downloads by subject area (Astrophysics, HEP, Mathematics, etc.).
Multiple institutions have requested this level of information and we
have updated our analytics to collect and provide it. We welcome your
suggestions for additional metrics.

**Looking Ahead**

Established in January 2010, the current institutional contribution
model is a 3-year interim strategy for 2010-2012 with the goal of
developing a long-term business plan that provides a strategic framework
by Summer 2012. The voluntary institutional contribution model targets
pledges from 200 libraries and research laboratories worldwide that
represent the heaviest institutional users of arXiv. The short-term
contribution model has been successful and with Cornell's contributions
has resulted in sufficient funds to cover all direct expenses for 2010
and 2011 as well as creating a contingency fund. Based on the outcomes
of the February planning meetings, we expect to announce a model for
2013-2017 by June 2012.

**Communication**

The arXiv sustainability initiative's website is
[http://arxiv.org/help/support](../../about/governance.md), including the quarterly
updates. You are also welcome to send your questions and input to
support@arxiv.org. We have an email list for sharing updates about
arXiv support efforts. If you received this update directly, you are
already subscribed. Others wishing to receive quarterly updates via
email are encouraged to join the list. Instructions are included below
this update.

In November 2011, we held three conference calls and had an opportunity
to talk with 31 colleagues on various issues related to arXiv. We will
hold three open conference calls in February (to accommodate different
time zones) and invite you to join one:

-   February 27, Monday, 4pm EST
-   February 28, Tuesday, 6am EST
-   February 29, Wednesday, noon, EST

We are very interested in understanding different perspectives on our
business modeling efforts and welcome suggestions, criticisms, and
encouragement! Please register for these conference calls at:
<https://cornell.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_exHO0ujL6C6kiji>

We thank all our supporters and welcome questions and suggestions.
