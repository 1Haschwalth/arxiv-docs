# Scientific Advisory Board

arXiv's Scientific Advisory Board is composed of scientists and researchers in disciplines covered by arXiv. The Board provides advice and guidance pertaining to the repository's intellectual oversight, with a particular focus on the policies and operation of arXiv's moderation system. The Board is governed by [Bylaws](../../about/sab_bylaws.md) that detail its duties, composition, and operation as well as the election of its members.
