# Accessibility at arXiv

Accessibility and access are not the same. Accessibility *ensures access regardless of disability*. arXiv is committed to making our platform and the research we host as accessible as we can. Because if it is not accessible, we can't call it open science.
{ .intro }

Accessibility is a robust field with a tremendous foundation of research at its core and active practitioners around the globe. At arXiv, we can contribute to these efforts in several ways:  We can lead by example and make the content we host accessible; we can promote and support discussions in the scientific community around the accessibility of research outputs; and we can help elevate the voices of scientists who directly face these barriers. Our current projects reflect these goals.

## Our Accessibility Projects

### Papers in HTML Format
The effort to offer arXiv-hosted papers in HTML format comes directly from our community: from scientists with disabilities and experts in accessibility. Learn more about how arXiv will add [papers in HTML format](about/accessible_HTML.md) to our existing PDF and source options.

### Accessibility Research Report
The research content hosted by arXiv is not fully accessible to everyone due to disabilities and other barriers. In this paper, we describe the issues, review current mitigations, share the results of our user research, and present arXivâ€™s proposed next steps. Read the [Accessibility Report](about/accessibility_research_report.md).

### Accessibility Forum 2023
On April 17th arXiv hosted a forum to delve into how we can make accessible research papers a reality. Because if it's not accessible, can we really call it "open" science? Meet the presenters and watch the recordings from the [Accessibility Forum](https://accessibility2023.arxiv.org/).

## Further Reading
As arXiv continues on this journey to make our platform and the content we host as accessible as possible, we rely on the enormous contributions and foundational research of the accessibility community, as well as the insights of our users with disabilities who have so generously shared their knowledge and time. Below is further reading from our community, and some internal resources that we hope you find as useful as we have.

- A wonderfully clear [guide to alt-text](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P62YxEDDfG4DAofnaPiO4Y665eK4rCCD_EwjtF87iBk/edit?usp=sharing) from Dr. Cynthia Bennett

- [Userful terms](about/accessibility_terms.md) and brief historical context, as applies to arXiv.

TODO: many more resources listed here, gleaned from the forum website.
