# Submission Data FAQ

arXiv’s goal is to provide our members with the data they need to evaluate arXiv’s impact and value to their institutions. If you do not find an answer to your question below, please contact [membership@arxiv.org](mailto:membership@arxiv.org).

## How can I find my institution’s submission statistics?


Submission statistics are available to the member representatives of active arXiv member institutions and consortia. Emails with password protected links are sent to each member representative in the spring. If you are a member representative at an active member organization and you did not receive your link, please contact [membership@arXiv.org](mailto:membership@arXiv.org). Not a member yet? [Learn about membership here](https://arxiv.org/about/membership).


## Can I see a list of papers submitted by authors from my institution?


At this time, lists of papers submitted are only available to Champion members. To learn more about becoming a Champion member, please see our [membership information](https://arxiv.org/about/membership) or contact membership@arXiv.org.


## Where does arXiv submission data originate?


Submission data by institution was provided by [Scopus](https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/scopus), the curated abstract and citation database operated by Elsevier. Our member dashboards were created by connecting disambiguated authors and organizations to arXiv subject areas. 


Scopus uses [arXiv’s open APIs](https://arxiv.org/help/api/index) and then processes the data and returns it to arXiv for free. This once-a-year service is a contribution that recognizes the value of arXiv to the researcher community, and aims to help members understand the value of arXiv. 


## Why was Scopus selected to provide submission data?


In 2020, arXiv members requested submission data for their institutions, and in 2021, we used Microsoft Academic Graph to provide that data. When that service was deprecated, we searched for other solutions that could provide data by early 2022.Scopus agreed to provide this data for 3 years.


Scopus’ use of disambiguation and linking technology provided arXiv with a structure capable of quickly building reliable reports for members.[ Learn more about Scopus organization profiles here](https://www.elsevier.com/?a=1214537).


## Are download statistics for my institution available?


arXiv provides [general download counts](https://arxiv.org/stats/main) but no longer provides download statistics by institution. This decision was made in collaboration with the Member Advisory Board after careful consideration. Like many people around the world, arXiv readers and authors began working from home during the pandemic – so download statistics by institution, formerly estimated by institutions’ IP addresses, no longer represented the full value institutions gain from arXiv. At the same time, our members began asking for submission statistics, and our collaboration with Scopus enabled us to provide that information in a cost effective manner. Submission statistics help provide a snapshot of arXiv’s value to institutions. Of course, arXiv’s true value to the research community remains incalculable!


## I notice my institution’s submission data is different from the data released in 2020. Why?


Prior to 2022, submission count data was based on data from Microsoft Academic Graph. When that service was discontinued in 2021, we collaborated with [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri) to use their submission count.


## Why is it necessary to capture submission data?


arXiv provides usage data to member institutions as a member benefit so that they can better understand the value of arXiv to their researchers. Usage data is a component of [arXiv’s membership program](https://arxiv.org/about/membership), which provides approximately 30% of arXiv’s budget.


## How will this data help librarians and institutions?


The data will help librarians understand the research activities taking place across their campuses. Institutions will be better able to track changes in their institution’s research outputs posted to arXiv, identifying arXiv usage in different subject categories over time. The insights can be used to report on progress towards open access and other key strategic goals. They can also inform future planning.


## Is arXiv’s commitment to openness changing?


arXiv remains committed, as ever, to openness. This contribution from Scopus does not impact our commitment to our members and our mission to serve researchers.
