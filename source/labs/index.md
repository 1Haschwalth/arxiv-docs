arXivLabs is a framework for enabling the arXiv community to contribute to arXiv and develop tools that can benefit the scientific community. Current projects are featured in our [arXivLabs showcase](showcase.md).

arXiv welcomes anyone, from single individuals to large companies, to contribute ideas and share their products and services, as long as they abide by arXiv’s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.

## Categories

**arXivLabs** projects are categorized under the following:
<ol class="color-blocks">
  <li><strong>Community</strong> Projects that leverage arXiv services, and have an operational agreement or understanding, but are maintained and deployed fully outside of arXiv. These projects may need funding to offset costs.</li>
  <li><strong>Platform</strong> Experimental projects maintained by external collaborators and deployed (in whole or part) on arXiv infrastructure. These projects must meet additional technical criteria.</li>
  <li><strong>Core</strong> Experimental projects that add a great deal of value to the arXiv platform, and which are deemed feasible to maintain by the core arXiv IT team, may be incorporated as a core feature or service.</li>
</ol>

## Submit your proposal

We are now open for reviewing new proposals. Please [use our support portal](https://arxiv-org.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6) to fill out a proposal, or ask questions. See our [criteria](criteria.md) for arXiv Labs projects.

It is not necessary to be part of a Labs project to use the arXiv APIs. Many projects that use APIs and other methods to access arXiv's metadata, full text, or source files are **not** arXivLabs projects. Learn more about [arXiv API access and data usage here.](https://arxiv.org/help/api/)

_Note: Use of the names “arXiv”, “arXiv.org”, “arXiv Labs”, “arXivLabs” and associated logos, web addresses, and colors are only allowed with the explicit written permission from the arXiv management team._
