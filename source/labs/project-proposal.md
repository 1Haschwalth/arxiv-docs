# Submit your project to arXivLabs

_*arXiv Labs is back from vacation. As of December 2022 we are open for reviewing new proposals. Please email <a href="mailto:arxiv-labs&commat;arxiv&period;org">arxiv-labs&commat;arxiv&period;org</a> if you have something to propose*_

Visit [Labs criteria](criteria.md) to learn more about the criteria for Labs projects.

It is not necessary to be part of a Labs project to use the arXiv APIs. Many projects that use APIs and other methods to access arXiv's metadata, full text, or source files are **not** arXivLabs projects. Learn more about [arXiv API access and data usage here.](https://arxiv.org/help/api/)

arXiv welcomes anyone, from single individuals to large companies, to contribute ideas and propose their project for arXivLabs. All projects must abide by arXivâ€™s values of openness, community, excellence, and user data privacy.
