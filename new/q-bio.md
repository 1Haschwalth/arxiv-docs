The Quantitative Biology archive
================================

The Quantitative Biology archive ([q-bio](/archive/q-bio)) was [introduced](q-bio_announce) 15 Sep 2003.

Subject categories of the **q-bio** archive:

*   **BM - Biomolecules**  
    DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, etc.; molecular structures and folding kinetics; molecular interactions; single-molecule manipulation.  
    Moderators: Dave Thirumalai
*   **GN - Genomics**  
    DNA sequencing and assembly; gene and motif finding; RNA editing and alternative splicing; genomic structure and processes (replication, transcription, methylation, etc); mutational processes.  
    Moderators: Ralf Bundschuh 
*   **MN - Molecular Networks**  
    gene regulation, signal transduction, proteomics, metabolomics, gene and enzymatic networks.  
    Moderator: Andrew Mugler
*   **SC - Subcellular Processes**  
    assembly and control of subcellular structures (channels, organelles, cytoskeletons, capsules, etc.); molecular motors, transport, subcellular localization; mitosis and meiosis.  
    Moderator: Ned Wingreen 
*   **CB - Cell Behavior**  
    cell-cell signaling and interaction; morphogenesis and development; apoptosis; bacterial conjugation; viral-host interaction; immunology.  
    Moderator: Members of the subject area advisory board
*   **NC - Neurons and Cognition**  
    synapse, cortex, neuronal dynamics, neural network, sensorimotor control, behavior, attention.  
    Moderators: Gonzalo Polavieja and Carson Chow
*   **TO - Tissues and Organs**  
    blood flow in vessels, biomechanics of bones, electrical waves, endocrine system, tumor growth.  
    Moderator: Carson Chow
*   **PE - Populations and Evolution**  
    population dynamics, spatio-temporal and epidemiological models, dynamic speciation, co-evolution, biodiversity, foodwebs, aging; molecular evolution and phylogeny; directed evolution; origin of life.  
    Moderators: Luca Peliti and Richard Neher
*   **QM - Quantitative Methods**  
    all experimental, numerical, statistical and mathematical contributions of value to biology.  
    Moderators: Ralf Bundschuh and Eberhart Bodenschatz
*   **OT - Other**  
    Moderators: Ralf Bundschuh

### arXiv:q-bio advisory committee

The advisory committee members serve as consultants to Cornell University and to the [arXiv scientific advisory board](/about/people/scientific_ad_board). All arXiv policy decisions are ultimately made by Cornell University.

*   [Ralf Bundschuh](http://bioserv.mps.ohio-state.edu/~rbund/) (Ohio State): **chair and coordinator**.
*   [Michael Lässig](http://www.thp.Uni-Koeln.DE/~lassig/) (Köln): **coordinator and appellate moderator**.
*   [Chuck Stevens](http://www.salk.edu/faculty/stevens.html) (Salk): neural biology.
*   [Gary Stormo](http://ural.wustl.edu/stormo.html) (WUSTL): molecular biology and bioinformatics.
