{# ========== Template for main.html ========== 

This is a jinja template to creates main.html for arxiv custom mkdocs
theme. The main.html is also a jinja template.

It is processed by starting up a flask app with arxiv-base that
renders the Jinja template in this file. The output of that processing
is a jinja template found at mkdocs/arxiv_doc_theme/main.html.

By rendering this template with arxiv-base a new template for use by
mkdocs as a custom theme is created that has the static HTML from the
arxiv-base header and footer and a content block for the mkdocs
content.

The flask app is at theme_generator/app.py

========== How this works ==========
There are two levels at work in this file:
1. The custom template generation level
2. the mkdocs evaluation level

All the jinja directives in this file will be evaluated at the custom template
generation level first. Then when mkdoc is run that template will be evaulated.

So this comment will not appear in the custom theme tempalate. But a
comment surrounded by raw tags will show up in the custom tempate but
at mkdocs eval time it will not be added to the HTML output.

#}


{# The comment below will appear in the custom template, but not in the HTML output by mkdocs #}
{% raw %}{# This theme was generated by theme_generator/app.py, do not edit by hand #}{% endraw %}

{% set pagetitle = '{% if page.title %}{{ page.title }} - {% endif %}{{ config.site_name }}' %}
{% extends '/base/base.html' %}

{# ========== addl_head ========== #}
{% block addl_head %}
  {{ super() }}

  {# for mkdocs search #}  
  {% raw %}<script>var base_url = '{{ base_url }}';</script>{% endraw %}

  {% raw %}{# This is from theme_generator/generate_mkdocs_template.html

    It passes through the addl_head block from the arxiv-base templates
    and allows the same pattern to be used in the mkdocs markdown
    documents. #}{% endraw %}

    {% raw %}{% block addl_head %}{% endblock addl_head %}{% endraw %}
{% endblock %}

{# ========== content block for page.content ==========

This block sets the arxiv-base content block to receive the mkdocs page content

To get the page.contet to be rendered in the mkdocs HTML output, put
want the text {{ page.content }} in the main.html template at the
content block. That is what is done below.

#}
{% block content %} {% raw %}{{ page.content }}{% endraw %}{% endblock %}
