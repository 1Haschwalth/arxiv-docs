To Subscribe to the E-Mail Alerting Service
===========================================

If you would like to receive regular daily listings of the abstracts of
new submissions by e-mail, then you can subscribe to this service as
follows.

1.  Determine which archive is of interest to you, and obtain its e-mail
    address from the [list of available archives](archive_list).

2.  **For archives divided into subject classes:**  
    If the archive to which you are subscribing requires distinct
    subject classes (such as the `math`, `physics`, `cs`, `q-bio` and
    `q-fin` archives; but *not `astro-ph`, `cond-mat` or `nlin`*, see
    [handling subscriptions to all physics archives through
    physics](#physics) below), then you (un)subscribe to a specific
    category, indicating the categories in the body of the message. Here
    is an example

    > ` To: physics@arxiv.org Subject: subscribe John Smith add Biophysics del Plasma Physics`

    You may alternatively use the short subject class codes, for example
    to subscribe to the Risk Management category (`q-fin.RM`) in
    Quantitative Finance:

    > ` To: q-fin@arxiv.org Subject: subscribe John Smith add RM`

3.  **For archives not divided into subject classes:**  
    Send an e-mail message to the archive(s) of interest, in the
    following form

    > ` To: arch-ive@arxiv.org Subject: subscribe Your Full Name`

    You should give your name as you wish it to appear on the
    distribution list. Here is an example:

    > ` To: quant-ph@arxiv.org Subject: subscribe John Smith`

    (Subscribing to `cond-mat` in this way will subscribe you to all
    `cond-mat` subject classes.)

4.  **<span id="physics">Handling subscriptions to all physics archives
    through `physics`</span>**  
    The `physics` archive can be used to subscribe to any combination of
    existing physics archives, e.g. to something like \`General
    Relativity', \`Astrophysics', and \`High Energy Physics -
    Experimental'. This is also the only way to subscribe to a subset of
    the subject classes within the `astro-ph`, `cond-mat` and `nlin`
    archives. For example, to subscribe only to the `cond-mat` subject
    classes \`Soft Condensed Matter' and \`Superconductivity', the email
    would read:

    > ` To: physics@arxiv.org Subject: subscribe John Smith add Soft Condensed Matter add Superconductivity`

    If you want to change from, say, subscribing to all of `astro-ph` to
    subscribing to just `astro-ph.EP` then you must first
    [cancel](#cancel) the subscription to `astro-ph`, and then subscribe
    to `EP` through the `physics` archive.

To Cancel Your Subscription
===========================

If you want to cancel your receipt of the regular listings, you can do
so as follows.

1.  Find the e-mail address of the archive for which you are receiving
    the listings.
2.  Send an e-mail message to the archive, in the following form

    > ` To: arch-ive@arxiv.org Subject: cancel`

    Here is an example:

    > ` To: quant-ph@arxiv.org Subject: cancel`

    If you want to cancel your subscription to a particular subject
    class in an archive that supports subject classes, then see the
    example use of **`del`** in the **`subscribe`** command above.

Note that you may be subscribed through a remote listserv, or through
some local preprint distribution list at your end. You can determine the
origin of your subscription by examining the header from the daily
mailing you receive. You will have to deal with this through the
administrator of the remote distribution list.
