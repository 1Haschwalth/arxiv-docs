General Information About arXiv
===============================

Started in August 1991, arXiv.org is a
highly-automated electronic archive and distribution server for research
articles. Covered areas include physics, [mathematics](/archive/math),
[computer science](/archive/cs), [nonlinear sciences](/archive/nlin),
[quantitative biology](/archive/q-bio), [quantitative
finance](/archive/q-fin), [statistics](/archive/stat), [electrical
engineering and systems science](/archive/eess), and
[economics](/archive/econ). arXiv is maintained and operated by 
[Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) with
guidance from the [arXiv Scientific Advisory
Board](scientific_ad_board) and the [arXiv Member Advisory
Board](https://confluence.cornell.edu/x/NqlRF), and with the help of
numerous subject moderators.

Users can retrieve papers from arXiv via the web interface. [Registered
authors](registerhelp) may use our web interface to [submit their
articles](submit) to arXiv. Authors can also [update their
submissions](replace) if they choose, though previous versions
remain available.

Listings of newly submitted articles in areas of interest are available
via the web interface, via [RSS feeds](rss), and by [subscription
to automatic email alerts](subscribe).

**Disclaimer:** Papers will be entered in the listings in order of
receipt on an impartial basis and appearance of a paper is not intended
in any way to convey tacit approval of its assumptions, methods, or
conclusions by any agent (electronic, mechanical, or other). We reserve
the right to reject any inappropriate submissions.

This site should not be used to distribute non-technical information
(such as news or information about political causes of potential special
interest to the academic community). Submission of an abstract without
an accompanying paper will be rejected outright.

If you have questions about arXiv, please browse our [help pages](/help)
and the [arXiv primer](primer), or [contact the administrators
