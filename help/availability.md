Availability of submissions and announcement order
==================================================

Submissions to arXiv are typically made public Sunday through
Thursday, with no announcements Friday or Saturday. Check the [current
time](https://arxiv.org/localtime) at the arXiv main site, with the
amount of time remaining before the deadline. Submissions are made public as part of the scheduled announcement process. This includes new submissions as well as [replacements](/help/replace), [withdrawal notices](/help/withdraw), [cross listings](/help/cross) and [journal reference](/help/jref). Journal reference submissions do not appear in the mailings, but are still processed at that time. 

The final [arXiv identifier](arxiv_identifier) cannot be assigned until the paper is announced, so please do not ask for it ahead of announcement. It is not possible to make exceptions, nor accelerate the announcement schedule regardless of your circumstance. 

It may be the case that a submission appears in a different identifier month due to various factors. **Note:** The arXiv identifier cannot be back-dated, and identifiers are ordered based on the final timestamp of submitter action (i.e. when "submit" is clicked).
