## Can I reuse figures from an arXiv paper?

The short answer is "it depends". More specifically: 
  - If the [license](license) applied to the work allows for remixing or reuse with citation, then yes. 
  - If not, then no. 
  - If the version is assigned the [arXiv perpetual non-exclusive license](https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/), you will need to contact the submitter or copyright holder (if published) to determine applicable permissions.

## Do I need arXiv's permission to repost the full text?

**Note:** All e-prints submitted to arXiv are subject to copyright protections. arXiv is not the copyright holder on any of the e-prints in our corpus. 

In some cases, submitters have provided permission in advance by submitting their e-print under a permissive [Creative Commons license](license#licenses-available). The overwhelming majority of e-prints are submitted using the [arXiv perpetual non-exclusive license](https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/), which does not grant further reuse permissions directly. In these cases you will need to contact the author directly with your request.

## How can I determine what license the version was assigned?

All arXiv abstract pages indicate a license underneath the full text download options. 

The link will appear as just the text `(license)`, such as at [arXiv:2201.04182](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04182v2). Articles between 1991 and 2003 have an [assumed license](https://arxiv.org/licenses/assumed-1991-2003/license.html). These should be considered functionally equivalent to the arXiv non-exclusive license.  

If the license applied by the submitter is one of the Creative Commons licenses, then a "CC" logo will appear, such as at [arXiv:2201.04182](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04182v1).
