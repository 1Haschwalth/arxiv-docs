## Can I reuse figures from an arXiv paper?

A short answer is "it depends". More specifically: 
  - If the [license](license) applied to the work allows for remixing or reuse with citation, then yes. 
  - If not, then no. 
  - If the version is assigned the [arXiv perpetual non-exclusive license](https://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/), you will need to contact the submitter or copyright holder (if published) to determine applicable permissions.
