Contacting arXiv
===============================

## Membership and Giving

Information about institutional membership or contributions to arXiv can be found at [arXiv funding support](support), or contact <support@arxiv.org>.

## Technical queries

If you have questions about paper submission, accounts, and use of arXiv, review [help](/help) and [FAQ](/help/faq). If you require further assistance, contact us at <help@arxiv.org>. 

When contacting arXiv administrators, please include a detailed description of your problem. Note that arXiv help and moderation email addresses are monitored between 0900-1700 EST/EDT, Monday through Friday, subject to
administrator availability and the holiday schedule.

**To avoid a long delay in receiving a response:** 

-   Send a precise email including all relevant details (especially paper ids, rejection ids, URLs, etc.).
-   If you receive an automated response to your email, please read all instructions carefully.
    -   If there is no other identifying information in your message
        (e.g., paper id or rejection id), you may need to address your
        email with **"Dear arXiv,"** to bypass our SPAM filter.
-   *Do not include attachments with your email.*
    -   If your submission has failed, quote the rejection identifier in
        your email.
    -   If you need to correct files in your submission, [make a
        replacement](replace).
    -   If you feel that a file is necessary to explain your problem,
        first send an email with as many details as possible and ask if
        the attachment is truly necessary.
-   *Always* contact arXiv administrators before your submission is
    [announced](versions) if there is a technical problem that
    prevents processing.

## Moderation queries

If you have questions about the status of your submission, contact us at <moderation@arxiv.org>.
 
-   Send a precise email, including all relevant details (especially
    paper ids, former correspondence, submission summaries, etc.)
-   If you receive an automated response to your email, please read all
    instructions carefully.
    -   If there is no other identifying information in your message
        (e.g., paper id or rejection id), you may need to address your
        email with **"Dear arXiv-moderation,"** to bypass our SPAM
        filter.
-   Please be *patient*, as moderation appeals are complicated and may
    take some time.
