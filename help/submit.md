To submit an article
====================

<span id="guidelines"></span> Everyone who submits should read the
following general information:

-   We accept submissions only from [registered authors](registerhelp).
-   Submitters must grant arXiv.org a [non-exclusive and irrevocable
    license to distribute](license) or certify that the work is
    available under another license that conveys these rights.
-   Submitters must agree to [arXiv terms of
    submission](terms_of_submission).
-   [Formats for text submission](#text)
-   [Formats for figures](#figures)
-   [File names and case sensitivity](#files)
-   [Inclusion of data sets and ancillary files (data, programs,
    etc.)](#datasets)
-   [Title/Abstract preparation](prep)
-   [Check your submission and read messages](#read)
-   [Edit or replace your article if necessary](#replace)
-   [Take responsibility](#responsibility)
-   Special instructions for [third party
    submission](third_party_submission) and [index
    submissions](submit_index) for conference proceedings

Please note that we do not accept submissions with omitted figures,
tables or sections. We also do not accept "abstract only" submissions.
Such submissions are unhelpful to readers and of very limited archival
value.

-   To submit an article, use the [Submit form](http://arxiv.org/submit)
    or select "START NEW SUBMISSION" from your [user
    page](http://arxiv.org/user).

The availability of new submissions is explained below, in the section
on [availability of submissions and announcement order](#availability)
(*policy change 2017-01*). Note further that all official versions of
submitted articles are made publicly available. See the discussion of
[submission version availability](versions).

<span id="text"></span>

Formats for text of submission
------------------------------

Your submission to the archive must be in one of the following formats
(listed in order of preference):

-   [(La)TeX, AMS(La)TeX, PDFLaTeX](submit_tex)
-   [PDF](submit_pdf)
-   [PostScript](submit_ps)
-   [HTML with JPEG/PNG/GIF images](submit_html)

Our goal is to store articles in formats which are highly portable and
stable over time. Currently, the best choice is TeX/LaTeX, because this
open format does not hide information. Note that for this and other
[reasons](/help/faq/whytex) we will not accept dvi, PS, or PDF created
from TeX/LaTeX source. Users of word processors such as Microsoft Word
should save their documents as PDF and submit that. Note also that we
will not accept scanned documents, regardless of format.

<span id="figures"></span>

Formats for figures
-------------------

Figures for a submission can be in a number of common formats. These
include:

-   PostScript (PS/EPS, most common for line drawings, plots, etc.)
-   JPEG (ideal for photographic images)
-   GIF or PNG (best for non-photographic images, bitmaps)
-   PDF figures (only with PDFLaTeX)

If figure files are too large, then readers with poor network
connections will not be able to download them. Remember that arXiv has
many users with poor network connections (such as users in some
developing nations). If your submission has a large figure, be sure to
include it, but make all possible efforts to reduce its size. Note that
we do not accept submissions with omitted figures, even if you provide a
link to another server. See our [information on submission sizes](sizes)
and our [bitmapping help](bitmap) for more information. If you have
problems with a large submission, [contact arXiv
administrators](/help/contact).

If you submit figures with your (La)TeX source, use standard macro
packages (e.g., the `graphics` and `graphicx` packages) so that the
figures will appear in the document. Unfortunately, arXiv administration
cannot provide help with TeX-related issues, so seek help from your
colleagues if necessary.

<span id="files"></span>

File names and case sensitivity
-------------------------------

arXiv will accept only the following characters in file names:

> `a-z A-Z 0-9 _ + - . , = `

The presence of any other character (e.g. spaces, question marks,
asterisks, etc.) will cause the system to reject the file upload or
submission. These restrictions ensure maximum portability of the stored
files and minimize archival risk.

File names and extensions are also case sensitive on our system. The
file names `Figure1.PDF` and `figure1.pdf` are not the same. Whether
your local system is case sensitive (e.g. Unix) or not (e.g. Windows)
you must ensure that internal file references such as LaTeX figure
inclusion commands match case exactly.

<span id="datasets"></span>

Inclusion of data sets and ancillary files
------------------------------------------

There are limited facilities for including data sets and ancillary files
(data, programs, etc.) which are associated with articles submitted to
arXiv. See [separate instructions](datasets) about including data sets
and ancillary files.

<span id="prep"></span>

Title/Abstract preparation
--------------------------

See [separate instructions on the preparation of separate
title/abstract](prep) information. This information is used on the
abstract pages, in announcements, in RSS feeds, and to support
searching.

<span id="read"></span>

Check your submission and read messages
---------------------------------------

Before you make the final "Submit Article" step in the submission
process be sure to check carefully both the title/abstract (metadata)
and the processed files. If you see any errors or are unhappy with the
formatting then correct them or [contact arXiv
administrators](/help/contact) if there are problems you cannot resolve.

If you discover an error after submission but before public announcement
then select the Unsubmit (![unsubmit icon](/images/unsubmit.png)) icon
next to the submission on your [user page](http://arxiv.org/user) to
return it to the [incomplete status](submit_status#incomplete) allowing
modification and later resubmission. Unsubmitting an article takes the
article out of the processing queue and announcement will be scheduled
based on the later resubmission time.

In general, each day's submissions before 14:00 US Eastern Time
(EDT/EST) Monday through Friday are not made available to the general
public until 20:00 US Eastern Time (EDT/EST) Sunday through Thursday.
See the discussion of [availability](#availability).

<span id="replace"></span>

Edit or replace your article if necessary
-----------------------------------------

Edits before an article is publicly announced will not generate
additional versions. The date stamp associated with the submission will
be the time that the final "Submit Article" step is completed. Edits and
final submission before 14:00 US Eastern Time (EDT/EST) Monday through
Friday will not delay announcement. You may wish to check [current local
time](http://arXiv.org/localtime) at main site.

We encourage authors to update and to make corrections in their
articles. **DO NOT** make a new submission for a corrected article or
for an erratum. Rather [replace](replace) the original submission.

<span id="responsibility"></span>

Take responsibility
-------------------

Because putting articles on arXiv entails certain responsibilities,
authors must make their own submissions. Third-party submissions (by
secretaries for example) are often the ones that cause the most
problems, presumably due to lack of self-interest and related factors.

The following information is also required for submission:

-   Institutional affiliation for the author(s) must be provided.
-   Official report number(s) from the author(s) institution(s) must be
    provided.

Availability of submissions and announcement order
--------------------------------------------------

*Note: policy change 2017-01 regarding announcement order and the effect
of edits.*

Submissions to arXiv are normally made public on Sunday through
Thursday, with no announcements Friday or Saturday. Check the [current
time](https://arxiv.org/localtime) at the arXiv main site, with the
amount of time remaining before the "freeze".
