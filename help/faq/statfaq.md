# Frequently Asked Questions on Public Statistics

  - ### I'd like to know how many people have been downloading/reading my work. Are there any plans to add this facility?
    
    No.

  - ### Why not?

    arXiv has a strong philosophic reason for not publicizing these statistics. When one
    browses in a library it is very important (in fact legislated) that a userâ€™s records
    and information are confidential, and not subject to disclosure. For the benefit of 
    readers it is very important to maintain this sense of freedom from monitoring in 
    the electronic realm.

    Further, such "downloads" are difficult to assess for a variety of reasons.
    
    While statistics for individual papers are accumulated at arXiv 
    (primarily for assessing the overall activity levels), there are many other access
    points for these archives, including mirror sites and local
    redistribution points (not to mention local photocopying, etc.). For
    example, there are sites that simply download everything either for
    local printing or local caching; so there's sometimes an automatic
    lower bound on the raw number of accesses, which is not necessarily
    a measure of readership. On the other hand, this distributed access
    means as well that many papers may be significantly undercounted if
    one takes into account only the centralized public distribution
    points.
    
    There are as well other distorting factors. For example a paper's
    initial submission may have some minor technical processing problem,
    corrected by a quick replacement the next day, and hence have many
    2nd requests for a viewable version, perhaps artificially doubling
    the initial raw number of requests.
    
    In addition, it is impossible to distinguish between actual reading
    and browsing or other spurious requests. For example, many
    author use these papers as a substitute for memory --
    i.e. they know a paper with a particular equation, so get it just
    for that equation (should that count as reading?).
    
    *So before publicizing any such statistics, all the caveats would
    have to be clearly understood.*
    
    But then the very availability of statistics could have many
    undesirable consequences. Some segment of submitters might find it
    highly disappointing to see low "read" counts of their work. Furthermore, we don't wish to
    encourage people to try somehow to distort public statistics in
    their favor either by self-generating large numbers of requests, or
    by repeated replacement of their submission to generate multiple
    repeat requests.
    
    It could be argued that statistics may provide
    some useful information at least on the *relative* popularity of
    submissions, since the distributed access and other factors may be
    subsumable into some overall scale factor. However, even this information
    is ambiguous in many cases and publicizing read counts (even when accurate),
    could distort the impact of reseach topics within fields.
