# Textures

For the most part, Textures uses normal TeX that can be submitted to arXiv without modification. However, if the TeX file contains \\SetTexturesEPSFSpecial (used for figure inclusion), it will need to be commented out:

     %\\SetTexturesEPSFSpecial

and the following line added to replace it:

     \\SetepsfEPSFSpecial

The command \\SetepsfEPSFSpecial selects the standard way of dealing with Encapsulated PostScript as opposed to the Textures specific method.

## The Messy Details

The \\SetepsfEPSFSpecial and \\SetTexturesEPSFSpecial commands are defined in the input file boxedEPS.tex, which is included by Textures with the command \\input BoxedEPS. The functions of these commands are described in the comments of boxedEPS.tex. We need to use \\SetepsfEPSFSpecial because we use dvips to generate PostScript from the TeX output.

The fix described above is known to work with Textures v1.8 up to at least v2.0.4 and boxedEPS.tex dated Feb 1995 and Nov 1995.
