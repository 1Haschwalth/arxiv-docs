# Possible problems with arXiv transition to teTeX3

As of 2 November 2006, arXiv is running teTeX 3 with new tex macros trees for processing all new submissions and replacements. This represents a significant improvement over the old automatic TeX system but will likely be slightly disruptive initially. Submitters may have to change some of their (bad) habits, and possibly modify some TeX sources.

There follows an incomplete list of common symptoms, errors and fixes:

1.  Bad size declared in binary blocks of PostScript files ( %%BeginBinary: .... count ). Symptoms:
    
    dvips: ! premature end of file in binary section
    
    dvips:  expected to see %%EndBinary at end of data; struggling on
    dvips: ! premature end of file in binary section
    
    fix: figure must be corrected
    
2.  Newer AIP macros require certain fields to be declared. Symptoms:
    
    aip classes: ! Class aipproc Error: Missing \\keywords declaration.
    
    fix: provide the \\keywords{} entry for the article
    
3.  PoS class uses incorrect check for pdftex, it should do ifpdf instead. Symptom:
    
    ! Undefined control sequence.
              <argument> \\def \\hash {}\\pdfannotlink
    
    fix: obtain latest PoS class, if that doesn't help contact www-admin
    
4.  Authors can't bundle parts of hyperref package, either all or none. Symptom:
    
    (/3/texmf-2006/tex/latex/hyperref/pdfmark.def
    ! Too many }'s.
    
    fix: either bundle everything or nothing from the hyperref package
    
5.  Wrong test for pdftex, author needs to use ifpdf. Symptoms:
    
    ! Incomplete \\ifnum; all text was ignored after line 13.
    <inserted text>
    
    any test for pdfoutput may fail, because it is typically incomplete unless ifpdf macro is used, a common signature is
    
    ! Undefined control sequence.
      ... \\pdfannotlink
    
    fix: CTAN download ifpdf.sty which does the correct check
    
6.  Old JHEP.cls will not work, use recent JHEP3 instead.
    
    fix: don't use or include JHEP.cls, use latest JHEP3.cls or rely on arXiv's version.
    
7.  mn.sty and mn2e.cls (Monthly Notices of the Royal Society) will not work. We don't have a fix yet.
