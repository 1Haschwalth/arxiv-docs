[arXiv](/) monthly submission **rate** statistics, 31 Dec '03
=============================================================

(for the three largest "subject areas":  
"hep" = High Energy Physics, "cond-mat" = Condensed Matter Physics,
"astro-ph" = Astrophysics)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](hep_monthly.gif)  
Blue - Number of new hep (= hep-th/hep-ph/hep-lat/hep-ex) submissions
received during each month since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to hep in
clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](cond-mat_monthly.gif)  
Green - Number of new cond-mat submissions received during each month
since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to cond-mat in clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](astro-ph_monthly.gif)  
Red - Number of new astro-ph submissions received during each month
since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to astro-ph in clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](hca_avg.gif)  
Blue/Green/Red - Average number of submissions/month as a function of
calendar year for hep/cond-mat/astro-ph .  
While the astro-ph submission rate is likely to saturate and flatten out
(as hep did starting in '95), a simple extrapolation suggests that the
cond-mat rate will begin to exceed that of hep by calendar year '04.

The current submission rates (i.e. averaged over calendar year '03) as
percentages of the average '03
[overall](http://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions) average rate of
3284/month are roughly:

-   hep: 21.8%
-   cond-mat: 21.2%
-   astro-ph: 20.0%

> (The '03 submission rates for the [remaining](remmonthly.html) subject
> areas are:  
> math(+math-ph): 15.3%, quant-ph: 6.2%, physics(other): 4.1%, nucl:
> 3.8%, gr-qc: 3.6%, nlin: 1.8%, cs: 1.8%, q-bio: 0.4% )

The total number of submissions to date as percentages of the total
259888 submissions (i.e. Aug '91 through Dec '03) are roughly:

-   hep: 31.9%
-   cond-mat: 19.1%
-   astro-ph: 18.4%

> (The overall percentages to date for the remaining subject areas
> are:  
> [math(+math-ph)](math_monthly.gif): 10.9%,
> [quant-ph](quant-ph_monthly.gif): 4.6%, [gr-qc](gr-qc_monthly.gif):
> 4.4%, [nucl](nucl_monthly.gif): 4%,
> [physics(other)](physics_monthly.gif): 2.8%, [nlin](nlin_monthly.gif):
> 2.4%, [cs](cs_monthly.gif): 1.4% , [q-bio](q-bio_monthly.gif): 0.1% )

<span id="upper">For the first half of calendar year '03:</span> **84%**
of the new submissions came via web upload, **16%** via the original
e-mail interface, and **2%** via anonymous ftp upload. (The web upload
was enabled in June '96 after a multi-year wait for browsers to support
it. E-mail and ftp submissions were disabled in Jul '03.) For years
