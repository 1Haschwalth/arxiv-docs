[arXiv](/) monthly submission **rate** statistics, 31 Dec '01
=============================================================

(for the three largest "subject areas":  
"hep" = High Energy Physics, "cond-mat" = Condensed Matter Physics,
"astro-ph" = Astrophysics)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](hep_monthly.gif)  
Blue - Number of new hep (= hep-th/hep-ph/hep-lat/hep-ex) submissions
received during each month since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to hep in
clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](cond-mat_monthly.gif)  
Green - Number of new cond-mat submissions received during each month
since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to cond-mat in clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](astro-ph_monthly.gif)  
Red - Number of new astro-ph submissions received during each month
since Aug '91 (+ cross-listings to astro-ph in clear)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

![](hca_avg.gif)  
Blue/Green/Red - Average number of submissions/month as a function of
calendar year for hep/cond-mat/astro-ph .  
While the astro-ph submission rate is likely to saturate and flatten out
(as hep did starting in '95), a simple extrapolation suggests that the
cond-mat rate will begin to exceed that of hep by calendar year '03.

The current submission rates (i.e. averaged over calendar year '01) as
percentages of the average '01
[overall](http://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions) average rate of
2762/month are roughly:

-   hep: 26.5%
-   cond-mat: 21%
-   astro-ph: 21%

> (The '01 submission rates for the [remaining](remmonthly.html) subject
> areas are:  
> math(+math-ph): 11.5%, quant-ph: 5.8%, gr-qc: 3.9%, physics(other):
> 3.8%, nucl: 3.6%, nlin: 2%, cs: 1.6% )

The total number of submissions to date as percentages of the total
184310 submissions (i.e. Aug '91 through Dec '01) are roughly:

-   hep: 35%
-   cond-mat: 18%
-   astro-ph: 18%

> (The overall percentages to date for the remaining subject areas
> are:  
> [math(+math-ph)](math_monthly.gif): 9.4%, [gr-qc](gr-qc_monthly.gif):
> 4.7%, [nucl](nucl_monthly.gif): 4%, [quant-ph](quant-ph_monthly.gif):
> 3.9%, [nlin](nlin_monthly.gif): 2.6%,
> [physics(other)](physics_monthly.gif): 2.4%, [cs](cs_monthly.gif):
> 1.3% )

For calendar year '01: **75%** of the new submissions came via web
upload, **21%** via the original e-mail interface, and **4%** via
anonymous ftp upload. (The web upload was enabled in June '96 after a
multi-year wait for browsers to support it.) For years past:
