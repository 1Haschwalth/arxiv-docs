arXiv monthly submission **rate** statistics, 1 Jan '11
=======================================================

(for the four largest "subject areas": "hep" = High Energy Physics,
"cond-mat" = Condensed Matter Physics, "astro-ph" = Astrophysics, "math"
= Mathematics)

Blue/Green/Red/Purple - Average number of submissions/month as a
function of calendar year for hep/cond-mat/astro-ph/math(+math-ph).  
**Notes:** These are not meant to be interpreted as measures of research
output, but rather only as measures of the extent to which communities
deposit their ouput at arXiv.org. The graphic illustrates its adoption
by research communities that did not necessarily employ a formal prior
paper preprint distribution system, as did HEP.  
In calendar year '05, the astro-ph and cond-mat submission rates each
grew to exceed the hep rate (which appears to have flattened out in the
late '90s, suggesting 100% participation from that community, perhaps
fluctuating about a mean of roughly 732/month for the past 11 years
\['00: 709, '01: 733, '02: 747, '03: 716, '04: 747, '05: 723, '06: 716,
'07: 743, '08: 748, '09: 747, '10: 737 \]).  
math(+math-ph) has been growing even faster since 2002 (suggesting a
rapid adoption of this resource by an increasing percentage of the
mathematics community). It is misleading, of course, to compare
subfields of physics to the entirety of mathematics, since the current
total numbers of publications per year in the two domains are roughly
comparable. The contributions from [math subject areas](/archive/math)
are ordered vertically, from top down as \[MP AC AG AP AT CA CO CT CV DG
DS FA GM GN GR GT HO KT LO MG NA NT OA OC PR QA RA RT SG SP ST\], and
the largest seven per month averages in '10 were MP:132, PR:120, AG:113,
AP:110, CO:108, DG:95, NT:85 .  
The diminished cond-mat growth rate in recent years is due in part to
the shift of biologically related submissions from cond-mat.soft to
q-bio, and network/complex systems submissions from cond-mat.stat-mech
to physics.soc-ph.

The current submission rates (i.e. averaged over calendar year '10) as
percentages of the average '10
[overall](http://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_submissions) average rate of
5845/month are roughly:

-   math(+math-ph): 25.0%
-   astro-ph: 16.6%
-   cond-mat: 15.9%
-   hep: 12.6%

> (The '10 submission rates for the [remaining](remmonthly.html) subject
> areas are:  
> cs: 9.3%, physics(other): 7.0%, quant-ph: 4.8%, gr-qc: 2.9%, nucl:
> 2.3%, stat: 1.6% nlin: 1.0%, q-bio: 1.0% q-fin: 0.6% )

The total number of submissions to date as percentages of the total
649388 submissions (i.e. Aug '91 through Dec '10) are roughly:

-   hep: 22.3%
-   cond-mat: 18.2%
-   astro-ph: 18.0%
-   [math(+math-ph)](math_monthly.png): 17.6%

<span id="upper">For the first half of calendar year '03:</span> **84%**
of the new submissions came via web upload, **16%** via the original
e-mail interface, and **2%** via anonymous ftp upload. (The web upload
was enabled in June '96 after a multi-year wait for browsers to support
it. E-mail and ftp submissions were disabled in Jul '03.) For years
