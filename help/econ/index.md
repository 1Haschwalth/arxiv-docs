Economics archive (September 2017)
==================================

The Economics archive ([econ](/archive/econ)) was
[introduced](/help/econ/announcement) 26 September 2017.

The Economics archive currently only contains the single subject of
Econometrics, but according to demand we expect to add more subject
areas in the future, and the Econometrics subject can also be subdivided
further. Econometrics is a field, at the intersection of Economics and
Mathematical Statistics, which focuses on providing statistical methods
for the quantitative analysis of economic phenomena.

Subject categories of the **econ** archive are:

-   **econ.EM - Econometrics**  
    Econometric Theory, Micro-Econometrics, Macro-Econometrics,
    Empirical Content of Economic Relations discovered via New Methods,
    Methodological Aspects of the Application of Statistical Inference
    to Economic Data
