arXiv Primer
============

Started in August 1991, arXiv.org is a
highly-automated electronic archive and distribution server for research
articles. Covered areas include physics, [mathematics](/archive/math),
[computer science](/archive/cs), [nonlinear sciences](/archive/nlin),
[quantitative biology](/archive/q-bio), [quantitative
finance](/archive/q-fin), [statistics](/archive/stat), [electrical
engineering and systems science](/archive/eess), and
[economics](/archive/econ). arXiv is maintained and operated by 
[Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) with
guidance from the [arXiv Scientific Advisory
Board](/help/scientific_ad_board) and the [arXiv Member Advisory
Group](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/arxivpub/Member+Advisory+Board), and with the help
of numerous subject moderators.

This page outlines the purpose of this resource and the general
procedures for its use.

Goals and Mission
-----------------

arXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly
articles in specific scientific disciplines. Material submitted to arXiv
is expected to be of interest, relevance, and value to those
disciplines. arXiv reserves the right to reject or reclassify any
submission. Submissions are reviewed by expert moderators to verify that
they are topical and refereeable scientific contributions that follow
accepted standards of scholarly communication (as exemplified by
conventional journal articles).

As an electronic archive, arXiv makes a commitment to provide persistent
access to all announced submissions. arXiv is thus maintained with a
focus on the perpetual availability of submissions. This is accomplished
in part by controlling the types of files that can be uploaded to arXiv,
as well as restricting changes that can be made after submissions are
announced. In order to preserve the scholarly record, submissions are
not removed from arXiv after they have been announced.

arXiv is proud to be able to offer such a large collection of scholarly
work in a single location, without any fees and with support for users
around the world. arXiv supplements the traditional publication system
by providing immediate dissemination and open access to scholarly
articles (which often later appear in conventional journals). It is
important to note, however, that arXiv is not a repository for otherwise
unpublishable material, nor is it a refereed publication venue. The
moderation process is essential to ensuring that submissions are of
value to the arXiv communities, but there is also a limit to the ability
of administrators and moderators to provide feedback on submissions that
are determined to be inappropriate for arXiv.

As a user, your primary interactions with arXiv will likely be to browse
and view articles, and perhaps also to submit articles. Submitting
articles requires registration as a user, whereas browsing can be done
without registration, on either the main [arXiv.org
site](http://arxiv.org) or on any of arXiv's [mirror sites around the
world](/help/mirrors).

Browsing arXiv
--------------

All arXiv submissions are freely available, often in multiple formats.
Each submission has an "abstract" page where summary metadata for the
submission are displayed, along with the available download formats and
any additional services that apply to that particular submission.
Examples of extra services include trackbacks, INSPIRE reference data,
and chronological or subject-specific arXiv browsing via "previous" and
"next" links. Please note that some of the services mentioned are
third-party services that may not be available for every submission and
that are maintained by different administrative staff. Check carefully
any of the offered pages for additional information and separate help
documentation.

It may be tempting attempt to download a local copy of arXiv or to build
a dataset of articles for research. The system, however, is not designed
to withstand automated downloads. Accesses are thus monitored and the
system will [block sites](../RobotsBeware.html) attempting large
downloads or making rapid-fire requests in order to protect access for
other users. Access blocks can also be triggered by [PDF
plug-ins](pdf#plugin) sending accelerated requests to our server. To
avoid triggering a block, make sure you are not allowing your browser to
open the PDF files with a plug-in, and do not download a large corpus of
articles very quickly. You can also use one of our many mirror sites to
download papers instead of increasing the load on the main server.

Submitting to arXiv
-------------------

arXiv accepts submissions of scholarly articles in a variety of formats
from registered, endorsed users. The submission process can begin any
time after the user has successfully registered and involves several
stages:

-   metadata (separate title, author, abstract, etc.) preparation and
    file verification
-   pending submission status
-   announced submission
-   additions that can be made without submitting a replacement
-   revision preparation
-   etc.

arXiv submissions are meant to be available *in perpetuity*. Thus, arXiv
has high technical standards for the files that are submitted. The
submission process begins with the preparation of [valid metadata](prep)
for the paper and continues through a verification process whereby the
files uploaded are checked for certain problems. Valid upload formats
for the primary text file include **(La)TeX**, **PostScript**, **PDF**,
and **HTML**. There are specific restrictions for each of the primary
file types and only certain other supplementary file types are
acceptable; please consult the [submission instructions](submit) for
additional information. If there are problems with the metadata, error
messages on the screen should help you make corrections. If there are
problems with the files, an error report will be generated and the files
will be assigned a rejection id. In this case you should read the log
and attempt to correct the problem, or failing that send the rejection
id to the [arXiv administrators](contact) for assistance.

### User Endorsement

If you are a new user or are submitting to a new archive, you may be
required to find [endorsement](endorsement) before your submission will
be processed. Users with recognized academic affiliations may be exempt
from the endorsement process, while other users should contact [eligible
arXiv endorsers](endorsement#request) to verify that they are active
members of the scientific community. This process helps restrict arXiv
submissions to relevant and legitimate research contributions without
adding to the administrative cost of arXiv, and thus it is an essential
contribution to both the legitimacy and the sustainability of arXiv as a
free resource.

### Pending Submissions

arXiv submissions are not "announced" (made available to the public)
immediately after they are uploaded. Instead, submissions receive a
pending status until the next "freeze time". (The freeze time is the
daily submission deadline. This is always 14:00 US Eastern Time
(EST/EDT) on working business days, and the time until the next deadline
can be found on our [local time](../localtime) page.) If the files are
accepted, you will be assigned a tentative arXiv id, and the system will
send two notification emails to your registered email address. One email
will contain a copy of the metadata and a link to the submission. The
other email will contain the tentative arXiv identifier and the paper
password, which can be sent to co-authors so that they can also claim
ownership of the paper.

### Submission Replacements

If, after initial submission, you need to make corrections, **do \*not\*
use the back button on the browser to return to the submission form
since this will create a duplicate submission**. Instead, you can
correct errors or upload revisions for your submissions by making a
[replacement](replace). Replacements made before the "freeze" deadline
for the day will overwrite the original submission. Only the last files
uploaded before the freeze time will be made publicly available.
Replacements must always compile separately, which means that all
necessary files must be included, even if they have not changed from the
previous version. While the submission is pending, however, the
replacement form will also offer the option of editing only the
metadata. Simply select the "metadata only" box at the bottom of the
form. If you encounter technical problems with your submission that you
cannot correct through replacement, please make sure you have explored
our help pages before contact arXiv administrators for assistance.

### Submission Versions

After the freeze time, any replacement will create a new version. The
new version will be available for viewing on the same page as any older
versions; the newest version is always the default version of an article
displayed. arXiv maintains a separate record for each version submitted,
and all information will remain available as it was announced. Just as
we do not remove submissions after they have been announced, we do not
remove versions after they have been announced. If you have found a
critical error in your submission, you can submit a [withdrawal
notice](withdraw). The withdrawal *does not remove* any previous version
of the submission, but it allows the author to explain any problems with
the submission.

### Submission Availability

Submissions are typically made publicly available and announced within a
single business day, if they are not removed for technical or moderation
concerns. That is, a paper that is submitted before the freeze on a
Tuesday will be made publicly available Tuesday evening at 20:00 US
Eastern Time and announced via email a few hours later. Submissions made
before the freeze time on Friday, however, are not announced until
Sunday evening, and the submissions from the weekend are all pending
until the Monday freeze. For more information, see the [availability
schedule](submit#availability).

### Submission Moderation

All arXiv submissions are subject to moderation and may be removed
(while pending) or reclassified (at any time). Please see our
[moderation help page](moderation) for a full description of the
moderation process and the reasons a submission might be removed or
reclassified.

### Other Submission Actions

Finally, some changes can be made to a submission without submitting a
full replacement. Submissions can be [cross-listed](cross) to another
archive or subject classification without submitting a replacement.
Cross-listing adds the submission to the mailings for the new category
and makes it available in searches restricted to the other category. The
journal reference, report number, and DOI metadata fields can also be
modified separately by using a [special form](jref). Any other changes,
including changes to the Comments field, must be made in conjunction
with a full replacement of the submission, including all necessary
files.

Contacting arXiv administrators
-------------------------------

arXiv administrators respond to technical and moderation queries during
standard business hours on weekdays. All administrators are located in
New York, USA, and you should take the [local time](../localtime) into
account when you plan your submissions and attempt to contact the
administrators. If you have any problems with arXiv, we encourage you to
explore the [help documentation](toc) and [Frequently Asked
Questions](faq/index) thoroughly before contacting the administrators.
This will often result in a much faster answer to your question. If you
are still unable to resolve your issue, do \*not\* attempt to trick the
system or circumvent arXiv controls - for example, by removing required
figures from your submission, or by submitting a TeX document embedded
within an HTML file. You should send a description of the problem to the
administrators, after reading the [contact instructions](contact) for
information on how to address queries and what information is required
to resolve problems. We will make every effort to respond to your
question in a thorough and timely manner.
