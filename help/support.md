arXiv Business Support and Governance Model
===========================================

In January 2010, Cornell University Library (CUL) undertook a three-year
planning effort to establish a long-term sustainable support model for
arXiv, one that reduced arXiv's financial burden and dependence on a
single institution and transitioned it to a collaboratively governed,
community-supported resource. CUL identified institutions worldwide
where the use of arXiv was most active and worked collaboratively with
them to develop a membership and governance model based on voluntary
institutional contributions. A formal long-term plan took effect in
January 2013. In this new model, arXiv is supported by libraries and
research laboratories worldwide that represent arXiv's heaviest users,
as well as by CUL and generous matching funds from the Simons
Foundation.
