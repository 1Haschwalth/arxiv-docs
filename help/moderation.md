The arXiv moderation system
===========================

arXiv is a forum for professional members of the scientific community.
While arXiv prides itself on maintaining a permanent collection of
scientific work that is made available to the public quickly and without
cost to users, submissions to arXiv do require some minimal amount of
moderation.

Why does arXiv moderate submissions?
------------------------------------

arXiv is distinct from the web as a whole, because arXiv contains
*exclusively scientific research content*. Although arXiv is open to
submissions from the scientific communities, our team has worked behind
the scenes for a long time to ensure the quality of our content. Our
policy is:

> *arXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly
> papers in specific scientific disciplines. Material submitted to arXiv
> is expected to be of interest, relevance, and value to those
> disciplines. arXiv reserves the right to reject or reclassify any
> submission.*

Moderation helps to ensure that arXiv content is relevant to current
research at much [lower
cost](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ginsparg/physics/blurb/pg02pr.html) than
conventional peer-reviewed journals, so we can continue to offer free
access to the scientific community and the general public. Although our
system may be imperfect, submissions that are determined to be
inappropriate for arXiv may be still be posted on other sites or
submitted to peer-reviewed journals.

What suggestions do moderators make?
------------------------------------

The arXiv moderators are experts in their fields and in the types of
submissions that are appropriate for their subject classifications. They
evaluate based on the content of the submission and the policies of
arXiv.

arXiv moderators may recommend *reclassification* or *removal* of a
submission. Reclassification is frequently suggested for subject
classifications that are highly similar, in order to make sure that
submissions are posted first to the most appropriate archive.
Cross-lists may then be suggested for other archives that are also
appropriate classifications. A submission that is cross-listed to
another archive will still be announced in the mailings to the
alternative archive.

arXiv moderators will suggest the removal of a submission that violates
arXiv policies in some way. Potential reasons for removal are:

-   *Unrefereeable content.* arXiv accepts only submissions in the form
    of an article that would be refereeable by a conventional
    publication venue. Papers that do not contain original or
    substantive research, including undergraduate research, course
    projects, and research proposals may be removed. Papers that contain
    inflammatory or fictitious content, papers that use highly dramatic
    and mis-representative titles/abstracts/introductions, or papers in
    need of significant review and revision may be removed.
-   *Inappropriate format.* Abstract-only submissions, presentations,
    book announcements, book reviews, submissions without references,
    calls for papers, or advertisements may be removed. We do not accept
    submissions with line numbers, or submissions with watermarks.
-   *Inappropriate topic.* While arXiv serves a variety of scientific
    communities, not all subjects are currently covered. Submissions
    that do not fit well into our current classification scheme may be
    removed and, where possible, redirected to a more appropriate
    repository.
-   *Duplicated content.* If a moderator notices that a user has made
    many very similar submissions in a short amount of time, or that a
    new submission is really a revision of a recent submission, the
    moderator may request that the user consolidate the new submission
    into a replacement of the previous submission. This helps ensure
    that arXiv is as useful as possible for all of the various
    communities publishing here, and it can often help the author
    present a more unified body of research.
-   *Submission of copyrighted material.* Authors must hold copyright
    over the entirety of the submission when the files are uploaded to
    arXiv. arXiv cannot accept PDFs that have been downloaded from a
    publisher's website and contain a copyright statement or papers that
    contain material written by someone who has not authorized that
    content to be distributed on arXiv (including comments by referees
    and, of course, plagiarized material).
-   *Excessive submission rate.* Articles submitted to arXiv must be of
    refereeable quality, and there is a practical limit to the rate at
    which appropriate, independent submissions can be produced by any
    one person. Moderators may request that a particular author limit
    their submission rate if this author has a history of many
    submissions to inappropriate areas or of doubtful refereeability.

Can I appeal a moderation decision?
-----------------------------------

If you disagree with a moderation decision, you should submit an appeal
that explains clearly and succinctly what your arguments are.

-   Send a precise email, including all relevant details (especially
    paper ids, former correspondence, submission summaries, etc.) to
    <moderation@arxiv.org>.
-   If you receive an automated response to your email, please read all
    instructions carefully.  
    If there is no other identifying information in your message (e.g.
    paper id or rejection id), you may need to address your email with
    **"Dear arXiv-moderation,"** to bypass our SPAM filter.
-   The moderators are not referees and do not provide detailed feedback
    on submissions. Administrators thus cannot provide detailed feedback
    regarding submissions deemed inappropriate, and will not enter into
    extended discussion regarding submissions.
-   Please be *patient*, as moderation appeals are complicated and may
    take some time.
-   In some cases we may require that a paper be published in a
    conventional journal before an appeal is considered.

The appeals process allows moderators additional time to reconsider a
submission, but repeated appeals with no additional information cannot
be considered. If you send an appeal and the moderators reach the same
decision as they did initially, no further appeal should be submitted.
Extreme cases may be addressed to the appropriate [advisory
committee](scientific_ad_board.md) chair only.

Who are the arXiv moderators?
-----------------------------

[arXiv moderators](/moderators) are volunteer subject specialists who
have been approved by their discipline-level [advisory
committees](scientific_ad_board.md) and by arXiv staff.

Although the moderators may be publicly acknowledged, it is very
inappropriate to contact any moderator directly regarding your
submission. All communication about moderation decisions should be
addressed to <moderation@arxiv.org> or, in extreme cases, the
appropriate advisory committee chair. Moderators are encouraged not to
reply to personal correspondence regarding arXiv submissions.
