Misuse of arXiv Policy or Resources
===================================

You may have been re-directed to this page because we believe the
service which has directed you to arXiv may be violating arXiv policies
and/or misusing arXiv resources.

This page details known and suspected problem services; we recommend
arXiv users avoid them.

A common form of misuse of arXiv resources is the harvesting of user
emails for the purpose of spamming users. As noted on arXiv's privacy
page ([http://arxiv.org/help/email-protection](email-protection)):

*Email addresses or other personal information collected from arXiv data
must not be abused for unsolicited emailing or other forms of spam.*

Suspected cases of misuse

**arQiv.org**

This service is apparently sending unsolicited email to arXiv users.
Please note that arQiv.org is not affiliated with arXiv or with Cornell
University in any way. Do not use your arXiv username or password on
arQiv.org or any site other than arXiv.org. We regret that arQiv.org is
spamming arXiv users, and we are attempting to contact them to stop this
and to clearly distinguish their site from arXiv.org.
