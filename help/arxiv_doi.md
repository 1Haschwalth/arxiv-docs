arXiv DOIs with DataCite
========================

Starting in January 2022, arXiv will begin registering DOIs and submitting associated article metadata to DataCite on behalf of (and at no cost to) arXiv authors. The first articles to receive DOIs will be those with 2201.NNNNN identifiers, with all new articles receiving DOIs going forward. Following successful launch, we will begin minting “arXiv DOIs” for the approximately 2M articles in arXiv’s corpus published between 1991 and 2021.

The article abstract (/abs) pages will be updated to display the arXiv DOIs following the initial registrations no later than the end of Q1 2022.

**Why add DOIs when there are arXiv identifiers? Are arXiv identifiers going away?**

The arXiv identifier has existed for more than 30 years; we will continue supporting it and you may use it in your citations as an alternative to the arXiv DOI. We are issuing DOIs for several reasons:

Making article metadata available in a centralized location like DataCite allows research outputs to be more discoverable and harvestable.
Some funding agencies require DOIs for the research they are supporting.

**Will I still be able to provide an external DOI and/or journal reference with my article?**

Yes, we will continue to support the existing journal reference and DOI metadata fields for linking to versions of an article outside arXiv, and we strongly encourage authors to provide them when they become available.

**When will the arXiv DOI for my new article become available?**

If you have submitted an article from January 2022 onwards, we expect new articles to receive a DOI within 24 hours of them being announced on arXiv.

**When will the arXiv DOI for my older (2021 and earlier) article become available?**

We do not have an exact timeline for backfilling DOIs for older articles, but we will start with articles from 2021 and go back in time. We will periodically provide updates as we complete batches of registrations.

**Where will the arXiv DOI for my article link to?**

The arXiv DOI will link to the arXiv abstract (/abs) page using the canonical form of the arXiv identifier, so it will always point to the latest version of the article, e.g.

https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.NNNNN → https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.NNNNN

**Will replacing an existing paper with a new version generate a new arXiv DOI?**

Replacing an article with a new version will not generate a new DOI; however, the metadata associated with the existing DOI will be updated at DataCite to reflect the changes from the new version. 

**What is arXiv’s DOI prefix with DataCite?**
