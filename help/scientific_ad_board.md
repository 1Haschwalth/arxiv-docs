arXiv Scientific Advisory Board
===============================

arXiv's Scientific Advisory Board is composed of scientists and
researchers in disciplines covered by arXiv. The Board provides advice
and guidance pertaining to the repository's intellectual oversight, with
a particular focus on the policies and operation of arXiv's moderation
system. The Board is governed by
[bylaws](/help/faq/arXiv_SAB_bylaws.pdf) that detail its duties,
composition, and operation as well as the election of its members.

Current Board members are:

-   Eberhard Bodenschatz, Professor, Max-Planck-Institut für Dynamik und Selbstorganisation, Göttingen \| Professor of Physics, Cornell University

    University (*ex officio*, as chair of Quantitative Biology Advisory
    Committee)
-   Mark Doyle, Chief Information Officer, American Physical Society (APS Physics)
-   Gregory Gabadadze, Professor of Physics, New York University \|
    Associate Director of the Mathematics and Physical Sciences
    Division, Simons Foundation

## Subject Advisory Committees

The [physics](/new/physics#advisory_committee),
[mathematics](/new/math#advisory_committee), [computer science
(CoRR)](/corr/advisorycommittee), [quantitative
biology](/new/q-bio#advisory_committee), [quantitative
finance](/new/q-fin#advisory_committee), 
[statistics](/new/stat#advisory_committee), and [economics](/help/econ) archives each have
advisory committees, which are overseen loosely by the Scientific
Advisory Board. The chairs of the physics, mathematics, computer
science, and quantitative biology advisory committees serve as *ex
officio* members of the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board.
