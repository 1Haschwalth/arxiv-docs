arXiv Scientific Advisory Board
===============================

arXiv's Scientific Advisory Board is composed of scientists and
researchers in disciplines covered by arXiv. The Board provides advice
and guidance pertaining to the repository's intellectual oversight, with
a particular focus on the policies and operation of arXiv's moderation
system. The Board is governed by
[bylaws](/help/faq/arXiv_SAB_bylaws.pdf) that detail its duties,
composition, and operation as well as the election of its members.

Current Board members are:

Subject Advisory Committees
---------------------------

The [physics](/new/physics.html#advisory_committee),
[mathematics](/new/math.html#advisory_committee), [computer science
(CoRR)](http://arxiv.org/corr/advisorycommittee), [quantitative
biology](/new/q-bio.html#advisory_committee), [quantitative
finance](/new/q-fin.html#advisory_committee), and
[statistics](/new/stat.html#advisory_committee) archives each have
advisory committees, which are overseen loosely by the Scientific
Advisory Board. The chairs of the physics, mathematics, computer
science, and quantitative biology advisory committees serve as *ex
officio* members of the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board.
