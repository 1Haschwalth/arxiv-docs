============

The [my.arXiv.org](http://my.arxiv.org/arxiv) site is developing
personalization and recommendation features. The project explores
alternative ways of discovering relevant research in arXiv.org. The
research will draw on known information in the anonymous log data,
combined with machine learning and other theoretical techniques. There
are also options to further personalize recommendations, for users who
adopt a persistent my.arxiv login name.

As arXiv's hosting institution, Cornell University Library is pleased to
support this experimental arXiv recommender tool, though there are no
current plans to formally integrate it into the arXiv system. It is
being developed and studied by researchers from the academic units at
Cornell, Rutgers and Princeton, and funded as an NSF BigData project.

The BigData project ([BIGDATA: Mid-Scale: ESCE: Collaborative Research:
Discovery and Social Analytics for Large-Scale Scientific
Literature](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1247696))
focuses on the problem of bringing massive amounts of data down to the
human scale by investigating the individual and social patterns that
relate to how text repositories are actually accessed and used. It will
improve the accuracy and relevance of complex scientific literature
searches. The project is led by Paul Kantor (Rutgers University),
Thorsten Joachims (Cornell University), and David Biei (Princeton
University). The projected end date for the project in July, 2015.
