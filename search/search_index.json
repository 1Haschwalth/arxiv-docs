Variable Type Content pretty function ( var_list, rows, header, e ) Default mkdocs_macro Prettify a dictionary or object (used for environment documentation, or debugging). Builtin Jinja2 Filters These filters are provided by Jinja2 as a standard. See also the Jinja2 documentation on builtin filters ). Variable Type Content abs builtin_function_or_method Return the absolute value of the argument. attr function ( environment, obj, name, value ) Get an attribute of an object. foo|attr(\"bar\") works like foo.bar just that always an attribute is returned and items are not looked up. batch function ( value, linecount, fill_with, tmp, item ) A filter that batches items. It works pretty much like slice just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this is used to fill up missing items. See this example. capitalize function ( s ) Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others lowercase. center function ( value, width ) Centers the value in a field of a given width. count builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. d function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. default function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. dictsort function ( value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func ) Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Because python dicts are unsorted you may want to use this function to order them by either key or value. e builtin_function_or_method escape(s) -> markup escape builtin_function_or_method escape(s) -> markup filesizeformat function ( value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit ) Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB, 4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc). Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega, Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to True the binary prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi). first function ( environment, seq ) Return the first item of a sequence. float function ( value, default ) Convert the value into a floating point number. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0.0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. forceescape function ( value ) Enforce HTML escaping. This will probably double escape variables. format function ( value, args, kwargs ) Apply the given values to a printf-style _ format string, like string % values . groupby function ( environment, value, attribute, expr ) Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's :func: itertools.groupby . The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, indentfirst, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. You can also override the default base (10) in the second parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively. The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( eval_ctx, value, d, attribute, do_escape, idx, item ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( value ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, seq, func, item ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value, verbose ) Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging. random function ( context, seq ) Return a random item from the sequence. reject function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. rejectattr function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. replace function ( eval_ctx, s, old, new, count ) Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( value, slices, fill_with, seq, length, items_per_slice, slices_with_extra, offset, slice_number, start, end, tmp ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method soft_unicode(object) -> string striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( environment, iterable, attribute, start ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0). When the sequence is empty it returns start. title function ( s ) Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, policies, rv ) Converts URLs in plain text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated as paragraphs to be wrapped separately. xmlattr function ( _eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv ) Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict. All values that are neither none nor undefined are automatically escaped. tojson function ( eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumper, options ) Dumps a structure to JSON so that it's safe to use in <script> tags. It accepts the same arguments and returns a JSON string. Note that this is available in templates through the |tojson filter which will also mark the result as safe.

See also the Jinja2 documentation on builtin filters ). Variable Type Content abs builtin_function_or_method Return the absolute value of the argument. attr function ( environment, obj, name, value ) Get an attribute of an object. foo|attr(\"bar\") works like foo.bar just that always an attribute is returned and items are not looked up. batch function ( value, linecount, fill_with, tmp, item ) A filter that batches items. It works pretty much like slice just the other way round. It returns a list of lists with the given number of items. If you provide a second parameter this is used to fill up missing items. See this example. capitalize function ( s ) Capitalize a value. The first character will be uppercase, all others lowercase. center function ( value, width ) Centers the value in a field of a given width. count builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. d function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. default function ( value, default_value, boolean ) If the value is undefined it will return the passed default value, otherwise the value of the variable. dictsort function ( value, case_sensitive, by, reverse, sort_func ) Sort a dict and yield (key, value) pairs. Because python dicts are unsorted you may want to use this function to order them by either key or value. e builtin_function_or_method escape(s) -> markup escape builtin_function_or_method escape(s) -> markup filesizeformat function ( value, binary, bytes, base, prefixes, i, prefix, unit ) Format the value like a 'human-readable' file size (i.e. 13 kB, 4.1 MB, 102 Bytes, etc). Per default decimal prefixes are used (Mega, Giga, etc.), if the second parameter is set to True the binary prefixes are used (Mebi, Gibi). first function ( environment, seq ) Return the first item of a sequence. float function ( value, default ) Convert the value into a floating point number. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0.0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. forceescape function ( value ) Enforce HTML escaping. This will probably double escape variables. format function ( value, args, kwargs ) Apply the given values to a printf-style _ format string, like string % values . groupby function ( environment, value, attribute, expr ) Group a sequence of objects by an attribute using Python's :func: itertools.groupby . The attribute can use dot notation for nested access, like \"address.city\" . Unlike Python's groupby , the values are sorted first so only one group is returned for each unique value. indent function ( s, width, first, blank, indentfirst, newline, rv, lines ) Return a copy of the string with each line indented by 4 spaces. The first line and blank lines are not indented by default. int function ( value, default, base ) Convert the value into an integer. If the conversion doesn't work it will return 0 . You can override this default using the first parameter. You can also override the default base (10) in the second parameter, which handles input with prefixes such as 0b, 0o and 0x for bases 2, 8 and 16 respectively. The base is ignored for decimal numbers and non-string values. join function ( eval_ctx, value, d, attribute, do_escape, idx, item ) Return a string which is the concatenation of the strings in the sequence. The separator between elements is an empty string per default, you can define it with the optional parameter. last function ( environment, seq ) Return the last item of a sequence. length builtin_function_or_method Return the number of items in a container. list function ( value ) Convert the value into a list. If it was a string the returned list will be a list of characters. lower function ( s ) Convert a value to lowercase. map function ( args, kwargs, seq, func, item ) Applies a filter on a sequence of objects or looks up an attribute. This is useful when dealing with lists of objects but you are really only interested in a certain value of it. min function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the smallest item from the sequence. max function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute ) Return the largest item from the sequence. pprint function ( value, verbose ) Pretty print a variable. Useful for debugging. random function ( context, seq ) Return a random item from the sequence. reject function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. rejectattr function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and rejecting the objects with the test succeeding. replace function ( eval_ctx, s, old, new, count ) Return a copy of the value with all occurrences of a substring replaced with a new one. The first argument is the substring that should be replaced, the second is the replacement string. If the optional third argument count is given, only the first count occurrences are replaced. reverse function ( value, rv ) Reverse the object or return an iterator that iterates over it the other way round. round function ( value, precision, method, func ) Round the number to a given precision. The first parameter specifies the precision (default is 0 ), the second the rounding method. safe function ( value ) Mark the value as safe which means that in an environment with automatic escaping enabled this variable will not be escaped. select function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. selectattr function ( args, kwargs ) Filters a sequence of objects by applying a test to the specified attribute of each object, and only selecting the objects with the test succeeding. slice function ( value, slices, fill_with, seq, length, items_per_slice, slices_with_extra, offset, slice_number, start, end, tmp ) Slice an iterator and return a list of lists containing those items. Useful if you want to create a div containing three ul tags that represent columns. sort function ( environment, value, reverse, case_sensitive, attribute, key_func ) Sort an iterable using Python's :func: sorted . string builtin_function_or_method soft_unicode(object) -> string striptags function ( value ) Strip SGML/XML tags and replace adjacent whitespace by one space. sum function ( environment, iterable, attribute, start ) Returns the sum of a sequence of numbers plus the value of parameter 'start' (which defaults to 0). When the sequence is empty it returns start. title function ( s ) Return a titlecased version of the value. I.e. words will start with uppercase letters, all remaining characters are lowercase. trim function ( value, chars ) Strip leading and trailing characters, by default whitespace. truncate function ( env, s, length, killwords, end, leeway, result ) Return a truncated copy of the string. The length is specified with the first parameter which defaults to 255 . If the second parameter is true the filter will cut the text at length. Otherwise it will discard the last word. If the text was in fact truncated it will append an ellipsis sign ( \"...\" ). If you want a different ellipsis sign than \"...\" you can specify it using the third parameter. Strings that only exceed the length by the tolerance margin given in the fourth parameter will not be truncated. unique function ( environment, value, case_sensitive, attribute, getter, seen, item, key ) Returns a list of unique items from the given iterable. upper function ( s ) Convert a value to uppercase. urlencode function ( value, items ) Quote data for use in a URL path or query using UTF-8. urlize function ( eval_ctx, value, trim_url_limit, nofollow, target, rel, policies, rv ) Converts URLs in plain text into clickable links. wordcount function ( s ) Count the words in that string. wordwrap function ( environment, s, width, break_long_words, wrapstring, break_on_hyphens ) Wrap a string to the given width. Existing newlines are treated as paragraphs to be wrapped separately. xmlattr function ( _eval_ctx, d, autospace, rv ) Create an SGML/XML attribute string based on the items in a dict. All values that are neither none nor undefined are automatically escaped. tojson function ( eval_ctx, value, indent, policies, dumper, options ) Dumps a structure to JSON so that it's safe to use in <script> tags. It accepts the same arguments and returns a JSON string. Note that this is available in templates through the |tojson filter which will also mark the result as safe. Due to how this function escapes certain characters this is safe even if used outside of <script> tags.","title":"Builtin Jinja2 Filters"},{"location":"about/index.html","text":"About arXiv arXiv\u00ae is a free distribution service and an open archive for scholarly articles in the fields of physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. arXiv is a collaboratively funded, community-supported resource founded by Paul Ginsparg in 1991 and maintained and operated by Cornell University .

Below is our thinking behind this commitment and our roadmap for reaching and sustainably maintaining an accessible platform for the entire arXiv community. Table of contents Important Terms Accessible arXiv Roadmap to Accessibility How the arXiv community can help Important terms Accessibility = The practice of making a website functional for as many people as possible, including those using assistive technologies. ADA = The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is established federal law. It was written two years before the first website was launched and lacks specific digital guidelines, but the Supreme Court and the Department of Justice have confirmed that the ADA applies to the websites of \"covered entities\" such as Cornell University and arXiv. WCAG = The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines are developed and maintained by the W3C, who also develop international web standards for HTML, CSS, and more. The WCAG, while not law, are the most widely recognized set of guidelines to address web access for people with disabilities, and WCAG level 2.0 compliance is mandated by Cornell University. Accessible arXiv The arXiv community is diverse in every way and includes users with visual or other impairments, those who use assistive technology, and many other factors that can affect one's ability navigate the internet. Maintaining, expanding, and improving access for all users is our prime directive and must necessarily include accessibility. The reasons for prioritizing accessibility are vast but below are the top ten we have identified for our platform and users: arXiv's body of research papers is free and open to everyone from all over the world. A fully accessible website actively demonstrates arXiv's commitment to open access knowledge. A commitment to accessibility will positively reflect on and strengthen arXiv's reputation over the long term and puts arXiv on the right side of history. Accessible design offers clear and direct benefits to arXiv's extremely diverse and international user base. Accessible design is by its nature flexible, allowing content to faithfully render across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, operating systems, and bandwidths. We dont know what the future holds in terms of technology and device proliferation but maintaining accessible and standards compliant code will natively communicate with assistive technologies in a reliable and predictable manner over the long-term. Accessible websites, through their emphasis on core content and meaning and rejection of superfluous and bandwidth-hogging padding, greatly benefit those with a slow internet connection or limited bandwidth. The number of people with disabilities is large and growing. At least one billion people \u2013 15% of the world\u2019s population \u2013 have a recognized disability ( WHO global report ). In the USA it's one in four adults ( CDC report ) and rising ( 2018 DHS national report ). In addition there are many more who do not formally identify as having a disability but have permanent, temporary, or situational impairments that affect one's ability to fully interact with many web interfaces. Some examples are visual impairments (blind, requiring magnification, screen glare, and more), mobility impairments (physical injuries, paralysis, and more), and cognitive and learning disabilities (requiring additional time, use of highlighting tools, and more). Providing open access to arXiv for all users includes deploying and maintaining an accessible codebase that is flexible and communicates reliably with assistive technologies. Moderators and administrators are a critical part of arXiv's longevity and success. To ensure arXiv is open to all qualified moderators and administrators the interfaces that they use must be accessible. arXiv's user base is international and accessibility laws in countries besides the USA will become increasingly relevant and urgent in the future. Compliance with existing guidelines and a firm commitment to clean semantic markup will limit risk for arXiv and provide the best foundation for future accessibility compliance. arXiv has an established history of being in compliance with international HTML standards. Current semantic HTML5 standards are the next logical step in maintaining a compliant codebase, and are closely linked to accessibility. Studies have shown that an accessibility-focused development mindset leads to more innovation and higher levels of satisfaction for all users. When we shift our thinking away from the minimum legal compliance to focus instead on the opportunity and creative challenge of building better experiences for everyone, we create a more sustainable, user experience-oriented approach to development. Accessible thinking - which emphasizes clarity of content and meaning - has far-reaching positive impacts on the overall user experience. Last but not least accessibility is not just a great business practice and the right thing to do, it is a legal requirement and Cornell University policy. Roadmap to accessibility We are currently making significant strides to improve access for those using assistive technologies on arXiv's classic codebase, while the new arXiv NG platform is \"born accessible\"\u2014built with accessibility in mind from the ground up. Deploying arXiv NG is our top accessibility goal. Accessible browsing is the initial priority of the NG platform, and accessible moderator and administrative interfaces will follow. In addition another high priority goal at arXiv is to assist users in making their research content as accessible as possible upon submittal. \u201cCornell University is committed to providing an environment in which all people have an equal opportunity to participate in the university\u2019s programs, activities and services.\u201d Shannon Osborn, assistant director of Cornell IT How the arXiv community can help A fully accessible arXiv is important, meaningful, and ambitious. Significant development resources and user testing are needed to reach our targets and the arXiv community may wish to help in the following ways: Making user uploaded research accessible, including TeX, is an ambitious and exciting goal that benefits users of assistive technology, mobile devices, those on slow internet connections, and translation services.

Current composition of MAB: Member Advisory Board 1. Member Advisory Board 1.1 Cornell University (CU) holds the overall responsibility for arXiv\u2019s operation and development, with strategic and operational guidance from its Member Advisory Board (MAB) and its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). 1.2 The arXiv principles delineate the respective roles of CU, SAB, and MAB. See the arXiv Governance Model for a summary of each group's role. 1.3 Representation on MAB is reserved for libraries, research institutions, laboratories, and foundations that are members of arXiv and contribute to the financial support of the service (\u201cContributing Organizations\u201d). 1.4 MAB is elected from arXiv\u2019s membership and serves as a consultative body. 2. MAB Membership 2.1 Board Composition 2.1.1 MAB will have 13 voting members in three categories: 1) High-Contributing Organizations: Up to five voting members from Contributing Organizations that are preexisting consortia or national organizations and contribute 5% or more of arXiv\u2019s annual income generated by member fees (set at $15,000 per year for 2013). 2) Contributing Organizations: At least seven voting members from other Contributing Organizations. The exact number of members depends on how many members from High-Contributing Organizations are elected. 3) One voting member from the Simons Foundation. 2.1.2 MAB will have five non-voting ex officio members in three categories: 1) The arXiv Program Director & Scientific Director. 2) Other leads from the CU arXiv team as appointed by Cornell\u2019s University Librarian. The role of these members is to provide information and participate in Board discussions. 3) Two SAB representatives. The SAB and MAB operate in parallel, complementing each other and providing essential input for CU. To this end, the SAB appoints two members to serve as non-voting ex officio members of MAB; MAB appoints two members to serve as non-voting ex officio members of the SAB. 2.1.3 Board Officers a) Chair. The presiding officer of the MAB annual meeting is the arXiv Program Director. b) Other Officers. The Board may elect other officers as it deems necessary. 2.2 Member Qualifications Each voting member of MAB will be an employee or an officer of a Contributing or High-Contributing Organization. No Contributing or High-Contributing Organization may be represented by more than one candidate for election to the Board in any given election or have two representatives at the same time on the Board. 2.3 Term of Office 2.3.1 Elected members of MAB will serve staggered four-year terms. Board members will be divided into two types of approximately equal size. The first MAB appointments during December 2012 will include seven voting members with six-year appointments and six voting members with four-year appointments. 2.3.2 No Board member representing Contributing or High-Contributing Organizations may serve more than one consecutive four-year term. 2.4 Powers and Duties a) Chair. The Chair shall preside at all meetings of the Board to exercise general charge and supervision of the affairs of the MAB. The Chair shall see that all notices are duly given in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws. The Chair shall facilitate open and inclusive discussion and decision-making and shall attempt to state clearly the \u201csense of the Board\u201d when he or she determines that all Voting Board members are generally united in their judgment (in mutual concordance). The Chair shall perform such other duties as may be assigned by the Board. b) Other Officers. Other officers elected by the Board shall have the authority prescribed to them by the Board. 3. MAB Operation 3.1 MAB represents participating institutions\u2019 interests and advises CU on issues related to repository management and development, standards implementation, interoperability, development priorities, business planning, and outreach and advocacy. MAB also reviews and comments on arXiv budgets proposed by CU. For agenda items that require decisions, MAB will review and comment on proposals submitted by CU and may request additional information in support of their deliberations. MAB members can propose agenda items for discussion on topics within the scope of the group\u2019s role. Some topics will require open discussion, and some matters with action items will necessitate decision-making. 3.2 A quorum requires the participation of a minimum eight voting Board members out of 13 (not including ex officio members). 3.3 When the Board considers any matter that requires a decision, the opinion of any Board member who wishes to express an opinion will be considered by the Board. As deemed useful and needed, Roberts\u2019 Rules will be used in running meetings, moderating discussions, and approving decisions. 3.4 If the Board cannot agree on a decision, either the previous policy remains unchanged or no decision will be reached on the new business. Depending on the urgency of the matter, CU reserves the right to make a decision or leave the issue unsolved to be reconsidered in a future Board meeting. If there is a deadlock, either within MAB or in deliberations between MAB and the SAB, Cornell\u2019s University Librarian bears responsibility for dispute resolution. 3.5 The Board will have authority to adopt policies and procedures governing Board activities. The Board may form subcommittees as needed and delegate to committees such powers as it deems fit, as long as those powers do not impinge on the rights reserved to CU or to any other members. 3.6 With regard to MAB and SAB communication, Board agendas and discussion outcomes will be shared with the SAB for their review and comments. The SAB representatives in MAB will act as liaisons and may seek input from their colleagues as needed prior to or after the Board deliberations. 4. MAB Meetings 4.1 Meeting Frequency 4.1.1 Meeting dates, times, and places will be designated by the Board\u2019s Chair. The frequency and duration of meetings will be based on agenda items and their urgency. 4.1.2 There will be an Annual Meeting of the Board (ideally full-day and in-person), supplemented with regular update conference calls as needed (maximum two hours in duration). 4.1.3 Special meetings of the Board may be called at any time by the Chair or by a majority of voting Board members. 4.1.4 For board members who need assistance with their travel expenses to attend the in-person meetings, Cornell will provide $1,000 per person for U.S. participants and $1,500 for the oversees participants (assuming the meeting will be held in the U.S.). 4.2 Meeting Attendance 4.2.1 Any Board member who cannot participate in an in-person meeting may participate remotely via conference phone or web conferencing. 4.2.2 Depending on the nature of agenda items, deliberations \u2014 including reaching a consensus \u2014 can be carried out on the Board\u2019s mailing list. 4.2.3 A Board member who fails to attend or fails to have a designated alternate attend three consecutive regularly scheduled Board meetings may be deemed by the consensual agreement of the Board to have resigned. The resulting vacancy may be filled in accordance with the provisions of 4.3. 4.2.4 A quorum is required for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board (minimum eight Board members, not including ex officio members). 4.2.5 The Chair will preside at all meetings of the Board and will exercise general charge and supervision of MAB\u2019s affairs. The Chair will facilitate open and inclusive discussion and decision-making. 4.2.6 CU will assign a staff member as Secretary to take notes during meetings and prepare meeting minutes. MAB members will review and approve the minutes. The Board agendas and discussion outcomes will be shared with the SAB for their review and comments. A synopsis of the meeting outcomes will be shared with the arXiv members. 4.3 Designating Alternates: If an MAB member is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may designate an alternate to act as a Board member. The alternate must be an employee or officer of a Contributing or High-Contributing Organization. An alternate may attend Board meetings and will be deemed a member of the Board for all purposes for the duration of the designation. 5. Committees 5.1 Elections Committee 5.1.1 The arXiv Program Director will initially appoint an Elections Committee of between three and five representatives from Contributing Organizations. The purpose of the first Elections Committee is to oversee the initial elections process. 5.1.2 Every two years after the initial election, the MAB Chair will submit for the Board\u2019s approval a list of members to serve on the Election Committee. This list will contain no less than three and no more than five individuals and representatives from Contributing Organizations that do not currently have a representative serving on the Board. 5.1.3 The Elections Committee will determine the voting process, gather nominations, review the candidates proposed by the member institutions, and oversee voting. 5.1.4 Elections Committee members will serve for one election term or until their successors have been appointed. 5.2 Other Committees and Task Forces 5.2.1 The Board may create and appoint members to such other committees and task forces as the Board deems appropriate. Such committees and task forces will have the powers and duties designated by the Board, and they will give advice and make non-binding recommendations to the Board. 5.2.3 Each committee will consist of at least one Board member and will operate for the term designated by the Board. 5.3 Vacancies and Rules: The Board Chair may fill vacancies on committees. Each committee and task force may adopt rules for its meetings that are consistent with these Bylaws or with any rules adopted by the Board. 6. MAB Member Election 6.1 Board members representing Contributing Organizations and High-Contributing Organizations will be selected through an election by a majority vote of the member organizations. 6.2 Members will be elected from the candidates proposed by the Elections Committee or recommended in writing by any Contributing or High-Contributing Organizations, provided that such written nominations are accompanied by the consent of the nominee and submitted to the Board at least 30 days prior to the Annual Meeting of the Board. Submitted nominations must include a statement about the qualifications of a candidate. 6.3 Voting for representatives to MAB is open to all eligible member institutions, each of which shall have one vote for their category of candidates. 6.4 If an election is being held for filling High-Contributing Organizations seats and if there are more than five candidates, members in the High-Contributing Organizations category have two voting options: They may delegate their representation to a consortium or other proxy, with the voting representation of such proxies being equal to the number of members represented. A High-Contributing Organization may opt to ask each member cast a vote during an election. This process needs to be coordinated by the consortia liaison and each member organization will have one vote. 7. Resignation, Removal, or Replacement of a Board Member 7.1 Any Board member or designated alternate may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Board. If any Board member or designated alternate ceases to be employed by or affiliated with the Contributing or High-Contributing Organization that he or she represented at the time of his or her election, that member will be deemed to have resigned from the Board. The Board vacancy created will be filled in accordance with the provisions of Clause 7.2, below. If the Contributing or High-Contributing Organization that a Board member represents ceases to be a member of arXiv, then that Board member will be deemed to have resigned from the Board, and the Board vacancy created will be filled in accordance with the provisions of Clause 7.3, below. 7.2 In the event of a deemed resignation, the Contributing or High-Contributing Organization that was represented by the resigning Board member will have the right to designate a successor to serve the remainder of the resigning Board member\u2019s term. The Contributing or High-Contributing Organization may decline to name a successor, in which case the vacancy will be filled in accordance with the provisions of Clause 7.3. 7.3 A vacancy on the Board not filled in accordance with the procedures for a deemed resignation (Clause 7.2) may be filled by the consensual agreement of the Board at any meeting where a quorum is present. A Board member elected to fill a vacancy will be eligible to serve full, consecutive four-year terms. 8. Annual Fees To be considered a Contributing or High-Contributing Organization, organizations must pay annual membership fees by July 1 of each calendar year. Budgetary inability to meet a single year\u2019s membership fees will not terminate membership, provided that the member commits to making up the deficit within an agreed upon period not to exceed two years. 9. Amendments Within the confinement of arXiv principles, these Bylaws may be amended, or new articles adopted, by the consent of two-thirds of the Voting members of the Board then in office. Depending on the assessment of the arXiv Program Director, the changes may need to be reviewed by the SAB, Cornell\u2019s University Librarian, or the Cornell Counsel. History of Revisions Revision on August 4, 2015 The initial idea of 2-4 year staggering terms did not take into consideration the time needed for the group to come together as a team around a common set of goals and identify productive ways of contributing to arXiv. Given the fact that MAB is a new governance unit, we feel that the first couple of years were spent in clarifying and better formulating the actual role of MAB in arXiv's governance. MAB unanimously decided to modify 2.3.1: Elected members of MAB will serve staggered four-year terms. Board members will be divided into two types of approximately equal size. The first MAB appointments during December 2012 will include seven voting members with six-year four-year appointments and six voting members with four-year two-year appointments. Revision on May 26, 2016 Chair position added as Jim Mullins, MAB Member and Dean of Libraries, Purdue University Libraries volunteered to assume the role, which was approved by MAB as a pilot implementation. Revision on December 4, 2017 References to Chair have been modified as a decision was made during the 2017 MAB Annual Meeting for the arXiv Program Director to play the role, as originally included in the Bylaws. Revision on February 26, 2018 Section 9. Amendments, corrected to parallel SAB (by the two-thirds of Voting Members, not by the consensual agreement of all Board members then in office.).

See the arXiv Governance Model for a summary of each group's role. 1.3 Representation on MAB is reserved for libraries, research institutions, laboratories, and foundations that are members of arXiv and contribute to the financial support of the service (\u201cContributing Organizations\u201d). 1.4 MAB is elected from arXiv\u2019s membership and serves as a consultative body.","title":"1. Member Advisory Board"},{"location":"about/mab_bylaws.html#2-mab-membership","text":"2.1 Board Composition 2.1.1 MAB will have 13 voting members in three categories: 1) High-Contributing Organizations: Up to five voting members from Contributing Organizations that are preexisting consortia or national organizations and contribute 5% or more of arXiv\u2019s annual income generated by member fees (set at $15,000 per year for 2013). 2) Contributing Organizations: At least seven voting members from other Contributing Organizations. The exact number of members depends on how many members from High-Contributing Organizations are elected. 3) One voting member from the Simons Foundation. 2.1.2 MAB will have five non-voting ex officio members in three categories: 1) The arXiv Program Director & Scientific Director. 2) Other leads from the CU arXiv team as appointed by Cornell\u2019s University Librarian. The role of these members is to provide information and participate in Board discussions. 3) Two SAB representatives. The SAB and MAB operate in parallel, complementing each other and providing essential input for CU. To this end, the SAB appoints two members to serve as non-voting ex officio members of MAB; MAB appoints two members to serve as non-voting ex officio members of the SAB. 2.1.3 Board Officers a) Chair. The presiding officer of the MAB annual meeting is the arXiv Program Director. b) Other Officers. The Board may elect other officers as it deems necessary. 2.2 Member Qualifications Each voting member of MAB will be an employee or an officer of a Contributing or High-Contributing Organization. No Contributing or High-Contributing Organization may be represented by more than one candidate for election to the Board in any given election or have two representatives at the same time on the Board. 2.3 Term of Office 2.3.1 Elected members of MAB will serve staggered four-year terms. Board members will be divided into two types of approximately equal size. The first MAB appointments during December 2012 will include seven voting members with six-year appointments and six voting members with four-year appointments. 2.3.2 No Board member representing Contributing or High-Contributing Organizations may serve more than one consecutive four-year term. 2.4 Powers and Duties a) Chair. The Chair shall preside at all meetings of the Board to exercise general charge and supervision of the affairs of the MAB. The Chair shall see that all notices are duly given in accordance with the provisions of these Bylaws. The Chair shall facilitate open and inclusive discussion and decision-making and shall attempt to state clearly the \u201csense of the Board\u201d when he or she determines that all Voting Board members are generally united in their judgment (in mutual concordance). The Chair shall perform such other duties as may be assigned by the Board. b) Other Officers. Other officers elected by the Board shall have the authority prescribed to them by the Board.","title":"2.

MAB also reviews and comments on arXiv budgets proposed by CU. For agenda items that require decisions, MAB will review and comment on proposals submitted by CU and may request additional information in support of their deliberations. MAB members can propose agenda items for discussion on topics within the scope of the group\u2019s role. Some topics will require open discussion, and some matters with action items will necessitate decision-making. 3.2 A quorum requires the participation of a minimum eight voting Board members out of 13 (not including ex officio members). 3.3 When the Board considers any matter that requires a decision, the opinion of any Board member who wishes to express an opinion will be considered by the Board. As deemed useful and needed, Roberts\u2019 Rules will be used in running meetings, moderating discussions, and approving decisions. 3.4 If the Board cannot agree on a decision, either the previous policy remains unchanged or no decision will be reached on the new business. Depending on the urgency of the matter, CU reserves the right to make a decision or leave the issue unsolved to be reconsidered in a future Board meeting. If there is a deadlock, either within MAB or in deliberations between MAB and the SAB, Cornell\u2019s University Librarian bears responsibility for dispute resolution. 3.5 The Board will have authority to adopt policies and procedures governing Board activities. The Board may form subcommittees as needed and delegate to committees such powers as it deems fit, as long as those powers do not impinge on the rights reserved to CU or to any other members. 3.6 With regard to MAB and SAB communication, Board agendas and discussion outcomes will be shared with the SAB for their review and comments. The SAB representatives in MAB will act as liaisons and may seek input from their colleagues as needed prior to or after the Board deliberations.","title":"3.

The frequency and duration of meetings will be based on agenda items and their urgency. 4.1.2 There will be an Annual Meeting of the Board (ideally full-day and in-person), supplemented with regular update conference calls as needed (maximum two hours in duration). 4.1.3 Special meetings of the Board may be called at any time by the Chair or by a majority of voting Board members. 4.1.4 For board members who need assistance with their travel expenses to attend the in-person meetings, Cornell will provide $1,000 per person for U.S. participants and $1,500 for the oversees participants (assuming the meeting will be held in the U.S.). 4.2 Meeting Attendance 4.2.1 Any Board member who cannot participate in an in-person meeting may participate remotely via conference phone or web conferencing. 4.2.2 Depending on the nature of agenda items, deliberations \u2014 including reaching a consensus \u2014 can be carried out on the Board\u2019s mailing list. 4.2.3 A Board member who fails to attend or fails to have a designated alternate attend three consecutive regularly scheduled Board meetings may be deemed by the consensual agreement of the Board to have resigned. The resulting vacancy may be filled in accordance with the provisions of 4.3. 4.2.4 A quorum is required for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board (minimum eight Board members, not including ex officio members). 4.2.5 The Chair will preside at all meetings of the Board and will exercise general charge and supervision of MAB\u2019s affairs. The Chair will facilitate open and inclusive discussion and decision-making. 4.2.6 CU will assign a staff member as Secretary to take notes during meetings and prepare meeting minutes. MAB members will review and approve the minutes. The Board agendas and discussion outcomes will be shared with the SAB for their review and comments. A synopsis of the meeting outcomes will be shared with the arXiv members. 4.3 Designating Alternates: If an MAB member is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may designate an alternate to act as a Board member. The alternate must be an employee or officer of a Contributing or High-Contributing Organization. An alternate may attend Board meetings and will be deemed a member of the Board for all purposes for the duration of the designation.","title":"4.

This list will contain no less than three and no more than five individuals and representatives from Contributing Organizations that do not currently have a representative serving on the Board. 5.1.3 The Elections Committee will determine the voting process, gather nominations, review the candidates proposed by the member institutions, and oversee voting. 5.1.4 Elections Committee members will serve for one election term or until their successors have been appointed. 5.2 Other Committees and Task Forces 5.2.1 The Board may create and appoint members to such other committees and task forces as the Board deems appropriate. Such committees and task forces will have the powers and duties designated by the Board, and they will give advice and make non-binding recommendations to the Board. 5.2.3 Each committee will consist of at least one Board member and will operate for the term designated by the Board. 5.3 Vacancies and Rules: The Board Chair may fill vacancies on committees.

Submitted nominations must include a statement about the qualifications of a candidate. 6.3 Voting for representatives to MAB is open to all eligible member institutions, each of which shall have one vote for their category of candidates. 6.4 If an election is being held for filling High-Contributing Organizations seats and if there are more than five candidates, members in the High-Contributing Organizations category have two voting options: They may delegate their representation to a consortium or other proxy, with the voting representation of such proxies being equal to the number of members represented. A High-Contributing Organization may opt to ask each member cast a vote during an election. This process needs to be coordinated by the consortia liaison and each member organization will have one vote.","title":"6.

General & Editorial Principles 1.1. arXiv provides an open-access repository of scientific research to authors and researchers worldwide. 1.2. arXiv is a scholarly communication forum informed and guided by scientists and the scientific cultures being served. 1.3. Access to arXiv content via arXiv.org is free to individual end users. 1.4. Individual researchers can deposit their own content in arXiv for free. 1.5. Criteria and standards for depositing content in arXiv are maintained by the Scientific Advisory Board, and deposit is governed by transparent and publicly posted policies and procedures. 1.6. arXiv serves the needs of researchers in physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, and statistics. Any expansion into other subjects or disciplines must include scholarly community support, satisfy arXiv\u2019s quality standards, and take into consideration its operational capacity and financial requirements. 1.7. Whenever possible, arXiv adopts open-source software and relevant standards and best practices. 2. Governance Principles 2. Role of Cornell University 2.1. CUL holds the overall responsibility for arXiv\u2019s operation and development, with strategic and operational guidance from its Member Advisory Board (MAB) and its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB). 2.2. Cornell University: 2.2.a. Manages the moderation of submissions and user support, including the development and implementation of policies and procedures; 2.2.b. Operates arXiv\u2019s technical infrastructure, including system maintenance, standards implementation, and development initiatives for incorporating new features and services. 2.2.c. Coordinates and facilitates the meetings and deliberations of Member and Scientific Advisory boards. 2.2.d. Provides interfaces and data access to support open reuse of arXiv data. 2.2.e. Assumes responsibility for archiving to ensure long-term access and maintains arXiv mirror sites. 2.2.f. Establishes and maintains collaborations with related initiatives to improve services for the scientific community through interoperability and through sharing tools and software. 2.2.g. Administers the arXiv membership program and assumes ultimate financial responsibility for running arXiv. 2.2.h. Maintains a transparent and open communication strategy to engage and inform arXiv\u2019s key stakeholders. 2.2.i. Bears responsibility for developing a succession plan in the event it can no longer host the service. 3. Role of the Member Advisory Board 3.1. A Member Advisory Board is elected from arXiv\u2019s membership and serves as a consultative body. 3.2. The board represents participating institutions\u2019 interests and advises CUL on issues related to repository management and development, standards implementation, interoperability, development priorities, business planning, and outreach and advocacy. 3.3. Membership in arXiv and representation on the MAB is reserved for libraries, research institutions, laboratories, and foundations that contribute to the financial support of the service. 3.4. Voting for representatives to the MAB is open to all eligible member institutions, each of which shall have one vote. Member institutions may delegate their representation to a consortium or other proxy<sup1</supwith the voting representation of such proxies being equal to the number of members represented. 3.5. The MAB is chaired by the arXiv Program Director from CUL and includes two members of the Scientific Advisory Board as non-voting ex officio members. The CUL IT and usersupport leads attend meetings as non-voting members to participate in discussions and provide background information. 3.6. The MAB reviews and comments on arXiv budgets proposed by CUL. 4. Role of the Scientific Advisory Board 4.1. The Scientific Advisory Board is composed of scientists and researchers in areas covered by arXiv. Chairs of subject Advisory Committees serve as ex officio members of the board. The selection process for the remaining members will be delineated in arXiv board bylaws. 4.2. The SAB selects a Chair from among its members. The Chair works with the arXiv director of user support to coordinate SAB activities. The roles of the Chair and the arXiv director of user support, with respect to the SAB, will be specified in arXiv board bylaws. 4.3. The SAB: 4.3.a. Provides advice and guidance pertaining to the intellectual oversight of arXiv, with particular focus on the policies and operation of arXiv's moderation system. 4.3.b. Reviews the criteria and standards for deposit in arXiv and proposes revisions to those criteria and standards as it deems warranted. 4.3.c. Proposes new subject or discipline domains to be covered by arXiv and/or reviews proposals for such domains. 4.3.d. Provides scientist feedback on arXiv development projects proposed by the MAB. 4.3.e. Makes recommendations regarding development projects \u2014 in particular, suggestions about improvements to the systems that support submission and moderation processing. 4.4. Two members of the MAB serve as non-voting ex officio members of the SAB. 4.5. The CU IT and user support leads attend SAB meetings as non-voting members to participate in discussions and provide background information. 5. General Governance Principles 5.1. To ensure transparency and accountability, arXiv provides annual operational and financial reports to member institutions. 5.2. The SAB and the MAB operate in parallel, complementing each other and providing essential input for CU<sup2</sup. To this end, the SAB appoints two members to serve as non-voting ex officio members of the MAB; the MAB appoints two members to serve as non-voting ex officio members of the SAB. 5.3. Members acknowledge that the host institution\u2019s legal obligations and fiduciary responsibilities place practical constraints on the formal governance structure and terms. Within these constraints, arXiv is committed to adhering to the stated governance principles, and to review periodically these principles. 6. Economic Principles 6.1. arXiv is supported financially by Cornell University Library and a global collective of institutional members, potentially supplemented by foundation grants. 6.2. CU has committed to contribute a cash subsidy of $75,000 per year in support of arXiv\u2019s operational costs and an in-kind contribution of all indirect costs, which currently represents 37% of total arXiv operating costs<sup3</sup. 6.3. Each member institution pledges a five-year initial funding commitment to support arXiv<sup4</sup. Membership fees may be adjusted annually to ensure that arXiv is sustained at an acceptable level of service, as determined by Cornell University in consultation with the MAB and the SAB. 6.4. Membership fees are equitable and based on an explicit fee structure. 6.5. Board proposals to CUL for service upgrades or development projects that require supplemental funding (that is, costs additional to the costs incurred for operating and maintaining the service) must identify the source of such funding prior to the upgrade being implemented. 6.6. Any fees for value-added services will be set at a level sufficient to recover the cost of providing the service and to contribute to arXiv operating costs. Supplemental services need to be provided on transparent and non-discriminatory terms, avoiding exclusive partnerships. 6.7. After a successful initial membership offering, if members\u2019 financial support falls below the level Cornell deems adequate to maintain arXiv at an acceptable level of quality, reserve funds will be used for two years to allow time for Cornell to secure sufficient funding support. Failure to do so may result in the development of an exit strategy, including the transition of arXiv to another institution. <sup1</supFunders may make their payment of membership fees for individual institutions conditional on those institutions designating the funder their proxy. However, monitoring such requirements would be beyond arXiv\u2019s purview. <sup2</supSpecifics of the composition, terms, selection, and goals of the Scientific Advisory Board and the Member Advisory Board will be articulated in the groups\u2019 bylaws (to be developed). <sup3</supCUL\u2019s indirect costs include library and departmental administration; staff support (finance/budget, human resources, facility staff, and staff IT); and maintenance, custodial, utility, and other facility related costs for the building. <sup4</supSee the arXiv Membership Program section about the specifics of the five-year commitment.

Membership fees may be adjusted annually to ensure that arXiv is sustained at an acceptable level of service, as determined by Cornell University in consultation with the MAB and the SAB. 6.4. Membership fees are equitable and based on an explicit fee structure. 6.5. Board proposals to CUL for service upgrades or development projects that require supplemental funding (that is, costs additional to the costs incurred for operating and maintaining the service) must identify the source of such funding prior to the upgrade being implemented. 6.6. Any fees for value-added services will be set at a level sufficient to recover the cost of providing the service and to contribute to arXiv operating costs. Supplemental services need to be provided on transparent and non-discriminatory terms, avoiding exclusive partnerships. 6.7. After a successful initial membership offering, if members\u2019 financial support falls below the level Cornell deems adequate to maintain arXiv at an acceptable level of quality, reserve funds will be used for two years to allow time for Cornell to secure sufficient funding support.

Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the most highly used mirrors, other mirrors account for few percent of total usage, 2) we have counted only one download per article and host per month to avoid misleading figures from repeat downloads of the same article (may lead to undercounting with shared machines and for users behind caches and proxies), 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting), and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads).

the 200 heaviest user institutions. See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the most highly used mirrors, other mirrors account for few percent of total usage, 2) we have counted only one download per article and host per month to avoid misleading figures from repeat downloads of the same article (may lead to undercounting with shared machines and for users behind caches and proxies), 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting), and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads). We have identified 7.8 million downloads from institutional domain names out of a total of 30 million downloads in 2009.

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads (this is a change from the 2009 statistics, which counted one download per host per month, and increases the number of downloads counted); 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (we have significantly increased the number institutions recognized which means that some institutions appear in the top 200 list that were erroneously omitted from the 2009 statistics. A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads).

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads (this is a change from the 2009 statistics, which counted one download per host per month, and increases the number of downloads counted); 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (we have significantly increased the number institutions recognized which means that some institutions appear in the top 200 list that were erroneously omitted from the 2009 statistics. A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads). We have identified 12.4 million downloads from institutional domain names out of a total of 50 million downloads in 2011.

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads (this is a change from the 2009 statistics, which counted one download per host per month, and increases the number of downloads counted); 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (we have significantly increased the number institutions recognized which means that some institutions appear in the top 200 list that were erroneously omitted from the 2009 statistics. A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads). We have identified 12.4 million downloads from institutional domain names out of a total of 50 million downloads in 2011.

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads (this is a change from the 2009 statistics, which counted one download per host per month, and increases the number of downloads counted); 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.)

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads; 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.)

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads; 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.)

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads; 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.)

These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads; 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.)

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads; 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.) We have identified 21.2 million downloads from institutional domain names out of a total of over 162 million downloads in 2016.

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads; 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.)

See also arXiv Support . Caveats: While we have taken considerable effort to extract reliable download data representing unique full-text downloads by real users, there are many factors which affect accuracy. These factors include: 1) the data is from the main arXiv site and the arXiv mirrors, though some mirror data is incomplete; 2) we have counted downloads according to the COUNTER algorithm which excludes rapid repeat downloads; 3) we have attempted to identify and remove robot or automated downloads from the count (false positives lead to undercounting, failing to identify robots leads to overcounting); and 4) we include here only downloads that appear to be from an institution based on the DNS name of the client for patterns that we recognize (A large fraction of downloads come from commercial ISPs which are not included. Clients with host names that don't resolve or off-campus accesses will lead to undercounting, failure to recognize institutional domain names will exclude those institutions and undercount the total institutional downloads.)

In 2019, we will launch the new interface, first for public beta evaluation and eventually to replace the classic submission interface. Status: In progress New Registration and Account Management Interfaces : We are rebuilding the user registration and account management interfaces to provide a more user-friendly experience, and to integrate with the NG submission system, API gateway, and other new components. Status: In progress Better Support for Bulk/Programmatic Access : We are rolling out a new API gateway for accessing arXiv metadata and content programmatically. This includes a refreshed search API, and better tools for accessing e-print content (e.g., for text and data mining). Status: In progress; Search API in alpha Author Name Disambiguation : Users have increasingly noticed the limitations of how we represent author names in e-print metadata ( see this blog post for details ). We will introduce new features that make it easier for submitters to associate author and institution names across e-prints, and improve the precision of author name queries in search. Status: Not started Under the Hood : Modernizing the Core Announcement Record: We have begun to outgrow the way that we store and access the canonical record of e-print submissions. We are dedicating a significant effort in 2019 to migrating the canonical record to a system that can scale with arXiv over the next decade, and make it easier to handle higher volumes of traffic. Status: In progress Continued Improvements to Search : We will continue to improve our search interfaces, and introduce new features throughout the year. For example, we plan to include full text search as part of the native search interface. Status: In progress Better Support for External Links : Users expect to be able to link to relevant source code, datasets, and other resources from their arXiv e-prints. We currently support limited linking from e-print abstracts and submission comments. We plan to release an interface that allows users to curate external links to their e-prints in a more organized fashion without requiring replacement submissions. Status: Deferred until 2020 Archiving arXiv : In order to ensure that we have a broad network of preservation strategies, in 2018 we began assessing several archival service providers with the intent to establish a third-party dark archive for our core e-print metadata and content. The dark archive will help to ensure perpetual long-term access to arXiv content in the event of a sustained outage to the arXiv.org platform. In 2019, we will begin working with one or more providers to implement this dark archive solution.

It provides open access to about 1.5 million e-prints in Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology, Quantitative Finance, Statistics, Electrical Engineering and Systems Science, and Economics. In 2018, the repository received 140,616 new submissions , a 14% increase from 2017. The subject distribution is evolving as Computer Science represented about 26% of overall submissions, and Math 24%. There were about 228 million downloads from all over the world. arXiv is truly a global resource, with almost 90% of supporting funds coming from sources other than Cornell and 70% of institutional use coming from countries other than the U.S. We\u2019ve Moved! After a careful assessment process, we moved the arXiv operation from Cornell University Library (CUL) to Cornell Computing and Information Science (CIS). Cornell has hosted arXiv since 2001 when its founder, Paul Ginsparg, left the Los Alamos National Laboratory and joined the Cornell faculty in the Physics and Information Science departments. Running the service has always involved a collaboration between CUL and CIS, as Professor Ginsparg and other CIS faculty lead R&D efforts through several NSF grants and other funding sources and contribute to the development of moderation policies. CIS\u2019s mission and values provide an environment that supports arXiv as a scholarly scientific enterprise, with the need for optimum service delivery and infrastructure sustainability. As an academic unit, CIS not only spans core contemporary IT realms, such as networks, systems, robotics, and machine learning, but is also concerned with the human aspects of computing, such as human\u2013computer interaction and human-centered design. For researchers and arXiv users, the stewardship transition did not affect any operation. But users should anticipate arXiv engaging in new partnerships to add new revenue sources, further strengthen arXiv\u2019s current business model, and invigorate community commitment to maintaining and developing arXiv as a public good. arXiv will continue to benefit from the expertise of the CUL staff, especially in the service areas of metadata, copyright, and scholarly communication policies and best practices. Please see the arXiv Transition FAQ to learn more about the impetus and process behind the move. Next Generation arXiv In 2017, we embarked on the next-generation arXiv (arXiv-NG) initiative with a cornerstone grant of $450,000 from the Sloan Foundation to improve the service\u2019s core infrastructure. Our strategy for the overall development and replacement of the infrastructure, is for incremental and modular renewal of the existing arXiv system, Classic Renewal , rather than building an entirely new system and migrating to it. Based on an assessment of various technology components and partnership options, we finalized an architecture and have been implementing some key technology components in 2018. An integral part of the arXiv-NG initiative is to consider new organizational and staffing models to ensure continuity of operations as the sustainability principles are at the heart of the arXiv-NG initiative. As we continue developing arXiv-NG, we are committed to continue arXiv's robust services. Sustainability Update arXiv's operation and development is funded by grants and a membership program that engages libraries and research laboratories worldwide. Currently, we have 231 members representing 27 countries. arXiv's 2018-2022 sustainability plan includes the following sources of funding: Cornell University provides a subsidy of $170,000 and makes an in-kind contribution of all indirect costs, which currently represents 37% of total operating expenses. The Simons Foundation contributes $100,000 per year in recognition of CUL's stewardship of arXiv. In addition, the Foundation matches $300,000 per year of the funds generated through arXiv membership fees. Each member institution pledges a five-year funding commitment to support arXiv based on institutional usage ranking (the annual fees are set in six tiers from $1,000-$4,400). To diversify funding sources, we also rely on grant funds from foundations and governmental agencies to sponsor new development projects and implement online fundraising campaigns to encourage giving by the arXiv's international user community. We remain grateful for the support from the Simons Foundation that has encouraged long-term community support by lowering arXiv membership fees and making participation affordable to a broader range of institutions. This model aims to ensure that the ultimate responsibility for sustaining arXiv remains with the research communities and institutions that benefit from the service most directly. Finding new, sustainable funding avenues to support current operations and upgrades of Classic arXiv's aging code has been an important effort for the arXiv team. Following a $450,000 grant from the Sloan Foundation in 2017, arXiv received $322,000 from the Heising-Simons Foundation to contribute to the arXiv-NG initiative. As reflected in the 2019 budget , the arXiv team is taking an integrated approach to consider the current operational system (Classic arXiv) and the next-gen system as a unified program. This approach is essential as we recruit and retain staff who will need to be conversant with the old and new systems, and transitioning from one to the other. We are strategically expanding the core arXiv development team to bring new skills to the arXiv-NG project, while continuing to provide excellent support and maintenance of the production arXiv system. Key Accomplishments and Plans for 2019 Since we started the arXiv sustainability initiative in 2010, an integral part of our work has been assessing the services, technologies, standards, and policies that constitute arXiv. Here are some of our key accomplishments from 2018 to illustrate the range of issues we have been trying to tackle. Please see the 2018 Roadmap for a full account of our work. Our development team has improved various search, browse, and accounts features as we reimplement , test, refine and continue to improve the arXiv platform. We also made significant progress reimplementing the submission user interface, API, and backend services with a new data architecture. Wherever possible, new software components are developed in public repositories and released under permissive open source licenses. Information about software releases can be found here . We continue to improve facilities for administrators and moderators in order to streamline their workflows, and to improve clarity and transparency of arXiv communications. During 2018, the arXiv team made improvements to the auto-endorsement system and created a moderator policy page. They also identified areas to improve help pages on user facing policies. We refined our overall process for prioritization and getting things done in arXiv-NG and continued to develop and implement methods for soliciting user input and feedback, particularly to guide arXiv-NG decision making, including a protocol for remote usability testing, and applied it to the development of a new moderation interface. Last July, arXiv added two new subject areas: Theoretical Economics and General Economics Our user support team updated our internal policies and practices documentation, filling in areas where policies have evolved. Our goal is to provide clear, consistent, established arXiv policies. Going forward we will be expanding and reorganizing policy documentation for moderators and submitters. With funding from the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) , we conducted a pilot to investigate the role of arXiv Labs in facilitating lightweight and more sustainable path for collaboration with Cornell Computing and Information Science through a reference extraction and linking project . We explored the implications of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and started to work with the Cornell experts in supporting related questions and requests from arXiv users. We continued to assess and refine arXiv\u2019s organizational and governance model and held an annual meeting for the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and Member Advisory Board (MAB) to discuss IT development priorities, financial state, moderation tools and policies, and fundraising strategies. As we witness the proliferation of preprint services, we collaborated with bioRxiv and ASAPbio in hosting a meeting of nascent preprint services to start discussing collaboration opportunities. We strengthened the daily oversight of arXiv and the arXiv NG development process of the arXiv team with a modified organizational structure and welcomed new team members. We also established a new external Technology Advisory Group to advise the IT leads. The 2019 Roadmap includes our goals as we strive to improve the technical infrastructure, moderation system, user support, and the sustainability framework. Additional information about arXiv is available on arXiv Public Wiki , including annual budgets, reports, roadmaps, and arXiv.org blog . As it is evident from this update, changes are afoot for arXiv, all aimed at ensuring that the scientific scholarship repository remains free, open, essential and sustainable. arXiv relies on a wide network of individual scientists who contribute their expertise and time. Paul Ginsparg, arXiv\u2019s founder, continues to make significant contributions through his involvement in the daily moderation process as well as developing and running some applications to help automate the quality control process. Composed of 165 subject experts, the worldwide network of arXiv moderators is an essential component of arXiv's success. They verify that submissions are topical and of interest to the scientific community, follow accepted standards of scholarly communication, and are classified in the appropriate subject categories. We salute their efforts that are crucial to our operation. We remain grateful for strong support from our member organizations, Simons Foundation , and essential contributions from arXiv's advisory groups as they consistently provide us with input as representatives of scientific and library communities.

Items are listed in approximate priority order, and are subject to change based upon consideration of input from the arXiv advisory boards and other stakeholders, assessment of new opportunities and initiatives as they arise, and progress on next generation arXiv development. Our overall goal of 2020 is to continue with the Next Gen arXiv (arXiv- NG) development plan to migrate from the existing arXiv system (\"Classic Renewal\"). We aim to progressively evolve arXiv into a modern and architecturally sound software system while maintaining the level of consistency and availability of the system as a whole. Related documents: arXiv software releases || arXiv development blog posts Technical NG Submission Interface: In 2018, we began work on a new user interface and API for submitting e-prints that will improve the user experience and make it easier to provide new features. In 2020, we will begin alpha testing, then moving on to public beta evaluation. Eventually it will replace the classic submission interface. New Registration and Account Management Interfaces: We are rebuilding the user registration and account management interfaces to provide a more user-friendly experience, and to integrate with the NG submission system, API gateway, and other new components. Accessibility Improvements: Reach the halfway point on our roadmap to better support accessibility. Service Status Communication: We will be adopting a service to centralize communication around the status of arXiv services, including planned maintenance and outages. Legacy Service Migrations to the Cloud: In 2019, our local service provider suffered several major outages that directly affected arXiv. We will begin migrating some of the legacy services to the cloud, starting with export.arxiv.org, to mitigate risk and improve service reliability. Compilation Service Updates: arXiv's TeX compilation service has not received major updates since it was last refreshed with TeX Live 2016. We will plan to include TeX Live 2020 for the next major update and to improve the overall process. We will also repackage the service as a container to remove dependencies on our legacy environment. NG Bulk/Programmatic Access: This includes a refreshed search API, reimplementation of the legacy arXiv API, RSS feed support, and better tools for accessing e-print content (e.g., for text and data mining), via an API gateway. Core Announcement Record Modernization: We have begun to outgrow the way that we store and access the canonical record of e-print submissions. We plan on migrating the canonical record to a system that can scale with arXiv over the next decade, and make it easier to handle higher volumes of traffic. Search Improvements: We will continue to make improvements to our search interfaces throughout the year, strongly informed by user feedback. Dark Archive for arXiv: We will work with service providers to establish a dark archive and ensure perpetual long-term access to content in the event of a sustained outage. Maintenance and Operational Support: A significant amount of developer effort is devoted to a range of activities that ensure that the service continues to run smoothly. Activities include (but are not limited to) to server maintenance and troubleshooting, service monitoring, analytics, internal support requests, bug fixes, and ad hoc meetings and conferences Moderation and User Support Help and About Page Updates: The about section of arXiv was started in fall 2019 and those pages will continue to be developed and organized. Technical help and policy pages will be updated on an ongoing basis and as components of arXiv Next Generation are rolled out. Planning Improvements for NG: There is ongoing work for additional updates to submission and moderation systems ahead of future NG software development in those areas. Some topics we are considering: support for various content types (proceedings, etc.), improved support for bulk and proxy submissions, explore alternatives for handling and displaying withdrawn submissions, improved workflows and communication for moderators, and update internal documentation on user account policies and identify ways to automate actions. User research process: Complete our formalized process, begun in 2019, for conducting and storing user research. Remaining work includes broadening our user feedback groups and establishing continuous research patterns. Business & Governance arXiv Planning: We will bring onboard a new Executive Director. This will initiate an assessment of arXiv goals, needs, mission, vision, and values. Based on this scope, we will start creating a plan to identify priorities, new development areas, and set strategic directions to create a framework for our fundraising, collaboration, and communication processes. In progress. Welcome Eleonora Presani as Executive Director Fundraising: We will strengthen and further diversify our fundraising strategies to support arXiv NG plan, including grants and inviting additional arXiv users (libraries, research organizations, and corporations) to become members and increase individual and corporation giving. We will also be exploring funding opportunities from several different government agencies, and possible grant funding from private foundations. Priority Setting & Communication: We will review our current processes for priority setting, feedback seeking, and communication to improve the transparency of how decisions are made and implemented.

In 2019, the repository received 155,866 new submissions , an 11% increase from 2018, and about 260 million downloads from all over the world. Leadership and Staffing Changes arXiv is excited to be recruiting a full time Executive Director. This new full-time position will lead arXiv into the future as a digital archive and open access distribution service for research articles. After 10 years of leading arXiv Oya Y. Rieger has stepped down from her role as Program Director to join Ithaka S+R as Senior Strategist. Oya has led a constantly evolving organization with a passionate user community, always moving ahead to ensure a sustainable, reliable service. Over her term, Oya has developed a diverse business model for arXiv and facilitated the initiation of the arXiv Next-Gen initiative. From her career as Associate University Librarian at Cornell and arXiv's Program Director, she has developed partnerships and served as an advisor to a broad range of scholarly communication initiatives. Her commitment to community engagement, transparency, open access, fairness, patience, and responsiveness have been embedded in the core values of the arXiv team. Erick Peirson, arXiv\u2019s Lead Architect, has also moved on from arXiv. Erick\u2019s technical designs have put arXiv on a solid path to the future for arXiv Next-Gen. He also initiated arXiv\u2019s move towards a more open development environment for external programmers and collaborators to engage with arXiv. In addition arXiv had 3 other staff positions change over in 2019. This meant that much of the team effort was put towards daily operations and shoring up operational stability. This shift in effort is reflected in some of our goals being deferred. Next Generation arXiv Our next-generation arXiv (arXiv-NG) initiative to improve the service\u2019s core infrastructure by incremental and modular renewal of the existing arXiv system continues to progress. This includes significant effort towards laying the foundations for the NG submission system, which the team hopes to alpha test in Q12020. Existing search, browse, accounts, documentation NG components received incremental improvements. The team also took the initial and essential steps to improve the overall accessibility of arXiv\u2019s user interfaces, both through behind-the-scenes structural improvements and user-facing changes (e.g. support for a mobile-friendly abstract page). Sustainability Update arXiv's operation and development is funded by grants and a membership program that engages libraries, research institutions, and societies worldwide. 243 members representing 30 countries supported arXiv in 2019. We remain grateful for the support from the Simons Foundation that has encouraged long-term community support by lowering arXiv membership fees and making participation affordable to a broader range of institutions. Our 2018-2022 sustainability plan aims to ensure that the ultimate responsibility for sustaining arXiv remains with the research communities and institutions that benefit from the service most directly. We continue to prioritize finding new, sustainable funding avenues to support current operations and development of arXiv\u2019s infrastructure. Key Accomplishments in 2019 and Plans for 2020 Key Accomplishments in 2019 and Plans for 2020 Since we started the arXiv sustainability initiative in 2010, an integral part of our work has been assessing the services, technologies, standards, and policies that constitute arXiv. Here are some of our key accomplishments from 2019 to illustrate the range of issues we have been trying to tackle. Please see the 2019 Roadmap for a full account of our work. We continue to improve facilities for administrators and moderators in order to streamline their workflows, and to improve clarity and transparency of arXiv communications. During 2019, the arXiv team expanded quality control flags. Our development team continued to improve and extend various search, browse, documentation, and other features as we reimplement, test, refine and continue to improve the arXiv platform. The team made significant progress reimplementing the submission user interface towards an alpha release, new and legacy APIs, as well as backend services. Wherever possible, new software components are developed in public repositories and released under permissive open source licenses. With a reduction of effort in Q42019 due to staff departures, the team shifted most of its remaining resources towards improving and maintaining the operational stability of the arXiv services. Our Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), under the leadership of Licia Verde, has clarified roles and responsibilities for the arXiv Subject Advisory Committees and the Committee Chairs. The effort for outreach and recruitment of new moderators has increased in 2019 with an aim to increase diversity among moderators. We have also modified the SAB membership to include greater representation and engagement with the newer fields that have joined arXiv. Two major policies were adopted in 2019 including the arXiv Code of Conduct and a Privacy Policy . We thank the staff, moderators, advisory boards, and arXiv users who have contributed to the development of the Code of Conduct. The arXiv team wished farewells to Janelle Morano (Community Engagement and Membership Coordinator), Jaimie Murdock (arXiv NG Developer), Erick Peirson (Lead System Architect), Liz Woods (User Experience Specialist) and Matt Bierbaum (arXiv Labs). We were pleased to welcome Shamsi Brinn as our new User Experience Specialist in October 2019 and Alison Fromme as new Community Engagement and Membership Coordinator in January 2020. We also initiated a search for a new Backend Python Developer in the last quarter of 2019. We moved information about our governance, business model, and reports to arXiv.org , to improve overall accessibility to pertinent information about arXiv's operations. This information was previously available on the arXiv Public Wiki . We continue to regularly update our community at the arXiv.org blog . As part of the organizational change to Cornell CIS we moved offices in 2019. The arXiv team now has its own dedicated space in historic Uris Library.

We are grateful for the coordinated international support from the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) Collections in the UK, SPARC-Japan, German National Library of Science and Technology (TIB), Helmholtz-Alliance Physics (Germany), and Denmark's Electronic Research Library (DEFF). We are currently contacting additional international library consortia for their possible leadership in coordinating support within some other countries. One of the outcomes of our sustainability initiative will be the development of a new arXiv governance structure. We currently envision the formation of an independent Advisory Board, representative of arXiv's key stakeholders, including researchers, libraries, and funding agencies. We seek a structure that will provide guidance on arXiv policy, strategic direction, and priorities, as well as independent auditing and review. We are in the process of reviewing governance structures of similar initiatives and services. We invite your input and ideas, especially if you know of any successful model that we should be considering. As part of our sustainability planning, we took a critical look at arXiv's technology infrastructure and prepared a high-level plan, which includes a major change to the discovery and access component of the platform. After having the proposal reviewed by four external colleagues with expertise in repository architectures, we decided to implement Invenio as the basis of a new display and access system. The move to Invenio will facilitate improved collaboration with our partners at NASA ADS and INSPIRE , and reduce the maintenance burden of in-house code. We anticipate the transition, which will include a number of user interface enhancements, to be completed by mid-2012. We often receive questions about the feasibility of providing submission-based statistics and comparing them with our current institutional downloads statistics. The author metadata for arXiv is not sufficiently consistent to support any systematic analysis but we ran some numbers based on submitting authors' email address affiliations. Based on sampling, we have some preliminary results, which indicate that submission- and download-based data exhibit similar characteristics. We continue to refine our findings and will appreciate ideas in regard to how this information can be used for business planning purposes. As part of the migration to Invenio, we will undertake some metadata remediation to improve the authorship data for existing submissions. This will enable better author linking, allow improvements in ownership claiming, and pave the way to support author identity linking using the proposed ORCID author identifiers. In collaboration with the NSF Data Conservancy project we have launched a pilot data upload interface for data associated with arXiv articles. Submission is unified through small extensions to arXiv's submission interface. While the article is announced and stored on arXiv, data is automatically deposited in the Data Conservancy repository and linked from the article (see http://arxiv.org/help/data_conservancy for more information). This is a pilot project, which will be re-evaluated in collaboration with the Data Conservancy by the end of this year. As a part of our initiative, we are making an effort to closely monitor and document expenses associated with running arXiv. The 2011 budget includes an in-kind contributions category to factor in a range of undocumented costs, such as indirect expenses associated with housing arXiv at Cornell.

To discuss how to achieve this goal, we will hold two planning meetings in February 2012\u2014one in the US and a second in Europe\u2014with representatives from the library and science communities. During the planning meetings, we will seek advice on arXiv's organizational structure and operating principles. We will also discuss a collaborative business model that continues to engage the libraries and research labs. The planning grant will be carried out between September 2011 and April 2012. We will share the outcomes of these meetings and make an effort to gather broader input during March 2012. News from the Operations Front We continue working with CERN to migrate arXiv to use the Invenio platform for our discovery and access interface. The decision to adopt Invenio was the result of a critical look at arXiv's technology infrastructure, undertaken last year as part of our overall sustainability planning. The move to Invenio will facilitate improved collaboration with our partners at NASA ADS and INSPIRE , and reduce the maintenance burden of in-house code. In the coming year, we expect to expand our programming staff by 0.5 FTE in order to assist with this effort and other current needs. We now anticipate the transition to Invenio, which will include a number of user interface enhancements, to be completed in the first half of 2013. This timeline has been revised outward by 6 months because of unforeseen difficulties in migration and to coordinate with the Invenio team's development schedule. On the user support side, our work with Paul Ginsparg to transition his moderation oversight role into regular arXiv administration processes managed by the Library was set back somewhat by the loss of Thorsten Schwander, who accepted a new position at CERN as the manager of INSPIRE. Thorsten has worked with arXiv for over fifteen years, maintaining and improving the TeX system much of that time, as well as working on the arXiv API and the SWORD deposit interface. Since mid-2011, Thorsten has relieved Paul Ginsparg of many routine oversight activities, which has helped the Library better understand those activities and how to transition them into the Library's arXiv operations. Thorsten's departure has required that we augment our user support staffing, and we are now seeking to fill a new position. The arXiv Senior Administrator will oversee and manage the daily user support and moderation activities associated with the administration of arXiv. Institutional Contributions Update In 2011, 133 institutions in 18 countries have pledged their support, totaling $424,000 in contributions. We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of supporting institutions: arXiv 2010 Supporters and arXiv 2011 Supporters . The budget information for arXiv is available here: CY2010 expenses and revenues , CY2011 expenses and revenues . We have a budget estimate for 2012 up on the arXiv website. You will notice that the annual expenses have increased due to our need to add a new user support person and a half-time programmer. We have just completed performing an analysis of the 2011 download activity in order to determine the top 200 constituents. There are not any significant variations between the 2010 and 2011. Next week, we will contact each institution on the list (or their representative) regarding 2012 support. As a new feature, we will provide a breakdown of institutional downloads by subject area (Astrophysics, HEP, Mathematics, etc.). Multiple institutions have requested this level of information and we have updated our analytics to collect and provide it. We welcome your suggestions for additional metrics. Looking Ahead Established in January 2010, the current institutional contribution model is a 3-year interim strategy for 2010-2012 with the goal of developing a long-term business plan that provides a strategic framework by Summer 2012. The voluntary institutional contribution model targets pledges from 200 libraries and research laboratories worldwide that represent the heaviest institutional users of arXiv. The short-term contribution model has been successful and with Cornell's contributions has resulted in sufficient funds to cover all direct expenses for 2010 and 2011 as well as creating a contingency fund. Based on the outcomes of the February planning meetings, we expect to announce a model for 2013-2017 by June 2012.

Thorsten has worked with arXiv for over fifteen years, maintaining and improving the TeX system much of that time, as well as working on the arXiv API and the SWORD deposit interface. Since mid-2011, Thorsten has relieved Paul Ginsparg of many routine oversight activities, which has helped the Library better understand those activities and how to transition them into the Library's arXiv operations. Thorsten's departure has required that we augment our user support staffing, and we are now seeking to fill a new position. The arXiv Senior Administrator will oversee and manage the daily user support and moderation activities associated with the administration of arXiv. Institutional Contributions Update In 2011, 133 institutions in 18 countries have pledged their support, totaling $424,000 in contributions. We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of supporting institutions: arXiv 2010 Supporters and arXiv 2011 Supporters . The budget information for arXiv is available here: CY2010 expenses and revenues , CY2011 expenses and revenues . We have a budget estimate for 2012 up on the arXiv website. You will notice that the annual expenses have increased due to our need to add a new user support person and a half-time programmer. We have just completed performing an analysis of the 2011 download activity in order to determine the top 200 constituents. There are not any significant variations between the 2010 and 2011. Next week, we will contact each institution on the list (or their representative) regarding 2012 support. As a new feature, we will provide a breakdown of institutional downloads by subject area (Astrophysics, HEP, Mathematics, etc.). Multiple institutions have requested this level of information and we have updated our analytics to collect and provide it. We welcome your suggestions for additional metrics. Looking Ahead Established in January 2010, the current institutional contribution model is a 3-year interim strategy for 2010-2012 with the goal of developing a long-term business plan that provides a strategic framework by Summer 2012. The voluntary institutional contribution model targets pledges from 200 libraries and research laboratories worldwide that represent the heaviest institutional users of arXiv. The short-term contribution model has been successful and with Cornell's contributions has resulted in sufficient funds to cover all direct expenses for 2010 and 2011 as well as creating a contingency fund. Based on the outcomes of the February planning meetings, we expect to announce a model for 2013-2017 by June 2012.

The Cornell team has been busy working on several fronts\u2014here are the highlights (some mentioned in previous updates): Implement a three-year interim plan (2010-2012) for seeking contributions from the top 200 institutions with heavy use: By the end of 2010, we received support from 123 institutions representing 11 countries, totaling $360,000 in contributions. So far in 2011 we have support from 114 institutions, totaling $324,000 in pledges from 12 countries. We anticipate the number of contributing institutions to grow. We gratefully acknowledge the contributions of supporting institutions: arXiv 2010 Supporters and arXiv 2011 Supporters . Budget information for arXiv is available here: CY2010 expenses and revenues and CY2011 budget projection . Review and stabilize arXiv staffing and organization by defining roles for management, IT development, and user support with clear lines of reporting and responsibility. Evaluate arXiv's IT infrastructure and develop and assess a plan for migrating the 20-year old search and display architecture to Invenio as the basis of a new discovery and access system. Develop an agreement with CERN to collaborate on further development and maintenance of Invenio (open sources digital library platform). Structure the arXiv budget within CUL accounting as a grant-funded account in order to adhere to Cornell's financial policies and to provide audit track. Hold discussions with a group of publishers and societies to discuss how to include them in the business planning process (interest in creating a funding pool in support of arXiv R&D such as data support and better linking among versions). Analyze and enhance arXiv usage metrics and statistics. We continue to improve our log analysis tools used to associate downloads with institutions. We have also conducted an indepth analysis of one month of submissions. Although only a sample, it indicates that submission and download-based usage data exhibit similar patterns. Explore potential legal status options to establish a community-based support and governance structure and appropriate procedures for strategic, operational, and fiscal oversight. During May 2011, we held 3 open informational conference calls and had an opportunity to talk with 27 colleagues on various issues related to arXiv. Here are some of the common questions we received during the calls: Will arXiv be expanded to other subjects? We frequently receive requests to extend arXiv to include other subject areas. We have adopted a measured approach to expansion, as there is significant organizational and administrative effort required both to create and to maintain new subject areas. Adding a new subject area involves exploring the user-base and use characteristics pertaining to the subject area, establishing the necessary advisory committees, and recruiting moderators. Also, although arXiv.org is the central portal for scientific communication in some disciplines, it is neither feasible nor necessarily desirable to play that role in all disciplines. While we anticipate that arXiv will become increasingly broad in its subject area coverage, we believe this development must occur in a planned and strategic manner. Do you keep track of the source of funding from the contributing institutions? Where are the funds coming from (library vs. other academic departments or administrative units)? We typically work directly with the acquisition units of contributing libraries and research centers and are usually unaware of the ultimate source of funding. We know of only a few cases in which the library acted as the liaison and funding came from an academic department within the institution. What is the relationship between arXiv and SCOAP3? Wouldn't SCOAP3 potentially cover the expenses associated with running arXiv? arXiv and SCOAP3 (Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics) complement each other. arXiv is critical for providing unrestricted and immediate circulation of initial research in several fields, not limited to HEP (see arXiv subject distribution ), whereas SCOAP3 tackles the issue of sustainable open access to peer-reviewed HEP publications by re-directing subscription funds. arXiv would potentially be a beneficiary of redirected funding administered by the SCOAP3 consortium. The conclusion of the SCOAP3 Global Partnership Meeting in April 2011 was to move towards an operational phase. It is not clear, however, when this initiative will be in full operation. It is important to note that the SCOAP3 initiative is restricted to HEP and particle physics content only, which represents between 18% and 40% of submissions to arXiv (depending how broadly the subject area is construed). If SCOAP3 is successful it could potentially subvent a similar fraction of arXiv's operating costs. We will continue to monitor the development of SCOAP3 and its impact on our long-term plans. Will you change the rates next year? We expect to keep the contribution support levels steady for the interim business planning period (2010-2012), and thus the rates will not change for CY2012. We are in the process of outlining a longer-term business model for 2013 and beyond. We anticipate that this model will continue to include contributions from institutions, and we are examining the feasibility and consequences of different support levels. What are the goals of the data conservancy pilot? We announced in the April 2011 update that in collaboration with the NSF Data Conservancy project , we have launched a pilot interface that allows arXiv submitters to upload data associated with their articles directly to the Data Conservancy repository. Links to the data are added in the arXiv record automatically. We currently have 23 such papers (see an example ). This is a research project and arXiv and the Data Conservancy make no guarantee about continued availability of data sets uploaded via this mechanism past the end of 2011. However, it is expected that the current Data Conservancy pilot projects will evolve toward much-needed long-term scientific data curation infrastructure that works seamlessly with article repositories such as arXiv.

We also hosted a meeting with the representatives from several publishers and societies that are interested in Cornell's sustainability planning efforts. The goal of the forum was to discuss the feasibility and desirability of establishing a research and innovation collaboration in support of arXiv. Potential collaboration areas discussed included strategies to improve crosslinking, supporting lifecycle of research materials and version control, supplementary material support, author authentication and verification, and automated metadata exchange.

News from the Operations Front We continue working with the CERN team to migrate arXiv to use the Invenio platform for our access interface. Developers working with the ADS, INSPIRE and arXiv projects met face-to-face in September at the 5th Summit of Information Providers in Astronomy, Astrophysics and High Energy Physics ( AAHEP5 ). They have together decided on changes to the web framework that Invenio uses that will better support functionality that ADS and arXiv require while also providing a good development path for INSPIRE and other projects using Invenio. arXiv now provides a login service for INSPIRE that facilitates sharing of author identity information between the two systems. When arXiv users login via this mechanism the list of articles on arXiv they have authored is automatically transferred to INSPIRE and used to seed the INSPIRE article claiming service. The arXiv team has completed a preliminary user study to inform Invenio-related web interface changes. We have also initiated a review of arXiv user guides and help pages.

Introduction Started in August 1991, arXiv.org (formerly xxx.lanl.gov) is internationally acknowledged as a pioneering and successful digital archive and open-access distribution service for research articles. The e-print repository has transformed the scholarly communication infrastructure of multiple fields of physics and plays an increasingly prominent role in a unified set of global resources for physics, mathematics, computer science, and related disciplines. It is very firmly embedded in the research workflows of these subject domains and has changed the way in which material is shared, making science more democratic and allowing for the rapid dissemination of scientific findings. arXiv is an international initiative and has mirror sites in 13 countries and collaborations with U.S. and foreign professional societies and other international organizations. It has provided a crucial life-line for isolated researchers in developing countries. Most scientists and researchers who post content on arXiv also submit their work for publication in traditional peer-reviewed journals. However, famously reclusive Russian mathematician Grigori Perelman's 2003 decision to post his proof of the 100-year-old Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture solely in arXiv underscores the repository's importance and its role in transforming scholarly communication. Since its inception in 1991 with a focus on the high energy physics community, arXiv has significantly expanded both its subject coverage and user base. It moved to Cornell with its founder, physicist Paul Ginsparg, when he returned as a faculty member in 2001, and is now a collaboration between the Cornell University Library and Cornell's Computing and Information Science Program. The library is responsible for arXiv's operation and maintenance, while research around the repository is performed in conjunction with the Information Science program. arXiv is a primary exemplar of an effective scholarly repository and is often cited to illustrate digital repositories' potential role in transforming scholarly communication, broadening access, and allowing for the rapid dissemination of scientific findings. Cultural practices within high energy physics such as the long-standing reliance on pre-prints likely influenced the initial rapid appropriation of arXiv within that community, but arXiv has since been adopted by many other communities with different practices. Through Paul Ginsparg's leadership the service has consistently focused on the disciplinary cultures represented in the digital repository and the needs of the user communities. Although arXiv is not peer-reviewed, the submissions are screened by subject-specific moderators to ensure content is relevant to current research in the specified disciplines (see arXiv's primer and moderation guidelines ). Additionally, an endorsement system uses community feedback to pre-screen new submitters. arXiv has facilities to harvest, record and display references and links to formally published versions of articles based on the deposited e-prints, thus providing an overt link to peer review. arXiv currently numbers over 580,000 e-prints. In calendar year 2009, arXiv accepted 64,047 new submissions and served over 30 million full-text downloads. 2. Business Model Scholars worldwide depend upon the stable operation and continued development of arXiv. Sustainability is best assured by aligning revenue sources with the constituents that realize value from arXiv, and by reducing dependence upon on Cornell University Library's budget. We have decided to pursue a collaborative business model that will engage the institutions that benefit from arXiv. Based on extensive feedback from arXiv stakeholders, we are proposing an interim business arrangement for three years that will provide the most immediately viable short-term funding model: income generated by recurring subsidies from the libraries at academic institutions, research centers, government laboratories, and other organizations that are the heaviest users of arXiv, managed through a tiered structure of annual support requests similar to many other open-access funding models. 2.1 Budget The calendar year 2010 budget for arXiv is \\$400,000, which includes costs for personnel and operating expenses (G&A overhead, hardware, hosting, and network charges; see budget summary ). Staff salaries account for about 80% of total annual expenses. We expect the annual budget to increase to $500,000 by 2012 to facilitate necessary upgrades and enhancements (see section 3.1 for more information regarding our technology agenda). Our goal is to continue providing this valuable component of the scholarly communication system at minimal cost to the community. The budget may be viewed as an effective cost per download of 1.3 cents, or alternatively, an effective cost per submission of <$7. 2.2 Collaborative support model We are seeking direct support from the heaviest institutional users of arXiv. Our tier-based support structure is based on the previous calendar year's download activity and will be applied equally to academic institutions, research centers, government labs, and other organizations. For consortia willing to promote and capture support for arXiv, we will offer a 10% discount for new supporting institutions and a 5% discount on renewals. No institutional site license is required. Initially a 3-tiered institutional support model will be implemented with a top-end rate of \\$4,000 per year, and a low-end rate of $2,300 per year. We seek support from institutions representing the most active users of arXiv, in both the United States and other countries. 2010 Support Request Rates Tier 1 The top 100 institutions bases on the previous year's download activity. These institutions account for approximately 55% of all institutional downloads from arXiv. \\$4,000/year Tier 2 Institutions that rank between 101 and 200 in terms of download activity and account for approximately 25% of all institutional downloads from arXiv. \\$3,200/year Tier 3 Institutions that rank below 200 in download activity and account for approximately 20% of all institutional downloads from arXiv. \\$2,300/year Institutions wishing to support arXiv should contact their consortia representatives or the arXiv office at Cornell University Library at support@arxiv.org. We anticipate that it will take time to attract sufficient support to meet arXiv's budget needs. If strong support results in a surplus then it will be reinvested in arXiv or result in reduced rates. See section 2.4 for a discussion of operating principles and Cornell support during transition to this model. 2.3 Why a use-based model? As a public good, arXiv should be supported by those institutions that use it the most. We have compiled a listing of the most active 200 institutions , based on download data, for calendar year 2009. We will compile and review usage data, by institution, on an annual basis and will notify institutions that have moved from one tier to another. We do not have precise statistics based on articles submitted to arXiv. This is because arXiv does not demand that submitters include affiliation information for authors, and does not control any affiliation metadata that is submitted. We can provide approximate statistics for supporting institutions but note that these should be interpreted with care. Early feedback from our colleagues indicates interest in submission statistics. Options for generating better statistics will be discussed by the arXiv Sustainability Advisory Group (see section 2.7 ). 2.4 Operating principles Cornell University Library is committed to maintaining arXiv as an open access service, free to submitters and users alike. Cornell University Library will initially implement an institutional support model that targets academic institutions, research centers, and other organizations (e.g. government labs) until a more diverse funding model can be developed. Cornell University Library will continue to provide a sizeable portion of the costs to operate arXiv, but that amount will diminish incrementally over the next four years. In 2010, Cornell University Library will subvent up to 75% of total annual costs; in 2011, the amount will decline to 50%; in 2012 to 25%; and thereafter remain steady at 15% of the operating budget. The budget for 2010 is approximately $400,000 per year. We expect this amount to go up to 500,000 by 2012 due to necessary upgrades and enhancements. Costs associated with institutional support management are factored in as a percentage of annual support income. Cornell University Library will not realize a \"profit\" from this support model; any surplus accrued will be reinvested in arXiv or result in reduced rates. 2.5 Development of a long-term business plan We realize that our business model needs to be responsive to the shifting ecology of scholarly publishing. As we continue to investigate long-term sustainability issues, our goal through this document is to articulate potential interim strategies. The sustainability scenario we propose represents a short-term strategy for the next three years. Our initial approach will be to collaborate with the libraries of the heaviest user institutions in the US and abroad in our effort to reposition arXiv as a vested online scholarly resource, an asset with shared benefits and accountability. Over the next few years we will develop a long-term business plan that provides a strategic framework to protect and increase the value of arXiv for those who use it. Ideally this will comprise a blend of ongoing underwriting from Cornell University Library and support from the academic library community and research centers. It might also include support from scholarly societies, an endowment, or funding agencies such as the NSF. We will strengthen existing collaborations (e.g. with the INSPIRE project of CERN, SLAC, DESY and Fermilab) and develop additional partnerships that allow arXiv to provide better services or to share the support burden. Advice from the Sustainability Advisory Group (see section 2.7 ) and other supporting institutions will be used in developing this long-term business plan. 2.6 Alternative revenue sources In the process of investigating business models we have considered many options. For a good overview see the Ithaka report on Sustainability and Revenue Models for Online Academic Resources . Alternative revenue sources considered included: Requesting donations at time of submission \u2014 We have no plans to impose article processing charges or submission fees. Barrier-free submission and use is one of the founding principles of arXiv. We have considered requesting donations at time of submission but have concluded that such fundraising would incur greater overhead than the institutional support model, and would not engage our peer institutions. We also want to ensure broad international contributions to the repository without financial expectations from the authors. SCOAP3 \u2014 arXiv would potentially be a beneficiary of redirected funding administered by the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (SCOAP3) consortium. It's not clear, however, when this initiative will meet its annual funding goal of \u20ac10,000,000 ($14,120,000). It should also be noted that the SCOAP3 initiative is restricted to HEP and particle physics content only, which represents between 18% and 40% of submissions to arXiv (depending how broadly the subject area is construed). If SCOAP3 is successful it could potentially subvent a similar fraction of arXiv's operating costs. We will continue to monitor the development of SCOAP3 and its impact on our long-term plans. 2.7 Governance arXiv is maintained and operated by the Cornell University Library, with guidance from the arXiv Scientific Advisory Board and several subject Advisory Committees. Additionally, the arXiv Sustainability Advisory Group provides an essential consultative role in developing diverse sustainability strategies for arXiv. 2.8 Benefits for supporting institutions Contributions will be openly acknowledged on the arXiv.org website. Within the first year arXiv will add banners recognizing institutional support ( \"Your access to arXiv is supported by University X\" or similar) and support for local OpenURL based services. Both of these features will be based on the IP address information supplied by the supporting institution. We will develop plans for additional benefits in consultation with supporting institutions, including more detailed usage statistics. 2.9 Why should my institution support arXiv? The recent Ithaka report on sustainability provides a comprehensive review of a variety of business models for supporting online academic resources. This report defines sustainability as \"the ability to generate or gain access to the resources financial or otherwise needed to protect and increase the value of the content or service for those who use it.\" Therefore, keeping open access academic resources such as arXiv sustainable involves not only covering their costs but also continuing to enhance their value based on the needs of the user community. Such a financial commitment is likely to be beyond a single institution's resources. arXiv has been one of the most important disruptive innovations in scholarly communications since the advent of the Internet. Its preemptive dissemination model represented the first significant means to provide expedited access to scientific research well ahead of formal publication. It remains an exemplar in the open-access debate. arXiv is a primary destination site for both authors and readers in its core domains within physics and math. If a case can be made for any repository being community-supported, arXiv has to be at the top of the list. We believe that arXiv sustainability should be considered a shared investment in a culturally embedded resource that provides unambiguous value to a global network of science researchers. 3. Technical Architecture The arXiv software was developed in-house at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Cornell over the past 18 years. The software is predominantly written in Perl with components that use Java, PHP and Python. Metadata and user information is stored in a MySQL database and Lucene is used to provide the search service. A key focus of software development has been to automate the operation of arXiv as much as possible, and continual improvement has been necessary to keep the administrative staff requirement from increasing as the number of incoming submissions has steadily increased. The three server machines that provide the main arXiv.org site are supported by Cornell's central IT organization with 24x7 support. Mirror sites are locally supported and receive updates daily. 3.1 Technical plans for maintaining and advancing arXiv While the underlying technology has been updated throughout its 18 year history, the system requires significant internal re-engineering to support an evolving technological landscape, increased growth and use, and to ensure the sustainability of the service. arXiv's success has relied upon a highly efficient use of both author and administrative effort, and has served its large and ever-growing user base with only a fixed-size skeletal staff. In this respect, it long anticipated many of the current \"Web 2.0\" and social networking trends: providing a framework in which a community of users can deposit, share and annotate content. It also helped initiate, and continues to play a leading role, in the growing movement for open access to scholarly literature. Improve submission system \u2014 We expect to roll out a complete revision of the arXiv submission system early in 2010. This will provide much improved user interaction during the submission process and will also streamline the workflow for moderators and administrators, giving much greater flexibility when handling submissions with technical or classification issues. Underpinning this new system are several infrastructural improvements which will facilitate later development and/or platform migration. Support for associated data and information objects \u2014 Digital data and associated multimedia information such as images and audio/video are becoming an integral part of scientific publications. To maintain its innovation role in scholarly communication, it is essential for arXiv to develop features in support of the deposit and archiving of supplementary information objects that are associated with a given paper. Scalable and expandable architecture for sustainability \u2014 The arXiv software has been developed in-house over many years and this has both benefits and burdens associated with it. To keep arXiv sustainable, it is important to re-engineer the software to layer arXiv-specific functionality over generic repository software. Creating a generalized architecture will facilitate efficient technology management processes and allow the implementation of digital preservation procedures and policies. 3.2 Subject area coverage and expansion The Cornell University Library frequently receives requests to extend arXiv to include other subject areas. In recent years we have added the fields of quantitative biology, statistics and quantitative finance; requests currently under consideration include mechanics and some areas of engineering. Due to limited resources, we have adopted a measured approach to expansion because there is significant organizational and administrative effort required both to create and to maintain new subject areas. Adding a new subject area involves exploring the user-base and use characteristics pertaining to the subject area, establishing the necessary advisory committees, and recruiting moderators. Although arXiv.org is the central portal for scientific communication in some disciplines, it is neither feasible nor necessarily desirable to play that role in all disciplines. However, arXiv can provide a model for other communities through improved service to its existing dedicated user communities, and act as an essential component of a global networked scholarly communication system. We anticipate that system will become increasingly broad in its subject area coverage, and increasingly diverse in its component databases, repositories, and other online tools and services. 3.3 Enduring access The first element in our plan is to ensure the long-term sustainability of arXiv as a service. This requires a solid business plan to support maintenance and expansion of the system. The second element is digital preservation of arXiv content. Digital preservation refers to a range of managed activities to support the long-term maintenance of bitstreams to ensure that digital objects are usable (intact and readable), retaining all quantities of authenticity, accuracy, and functionality deemed to be essential when articles (and other associated materials) were ingested. Formats accepted by arXiv have been selected based on their archival value (TeX/LaTeX, PDF, HTML, OOXML) and the ability to process all source files is actively monitored. The underlying bits are protected by standard backup procedures at the Cornell campus and off-site backup facilities in New York City provide geographic redundancy. The complete content is replicated at our mirror sites around the world and additional managed tape backups are taken at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Cornell University Library is developing an archival repository that will support preservation of critical content from institutional resources including arXiv. All arXiv documents, both in source and processed form, with be stored in this repository by the end of 2010. There will be ongoing incremental ingest of new material. We expect that the preservation costs for arXiv will be borne by the Cornell University Library leveraging the archival infrastructure developed for the library system.","title":"Whitepaper"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#arxiv-business-model-white-paper","text":"Cornell University Library January 15, 2010; last updated August 5, 2010 See also: arXiv Support and FAQ Contact: support@arxiv.org","title":"arXiv Business Model White Paper"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#1-introduction","text":"Started in August 1991, arXiv.org (formerly xxx.lanl.gov) is internationally acknowledged as a pioneering and successful digital archive and open-access distribution service for research articles.

Cornell University Library will initially implement an institutional support model that targets academic institutions, research centers, and other organizations (e.g. government labs) until a more diverse funding model can be developed. Cornell University Library will continue to provide a sizeable portion of the costs to operate arXiv, but that amount will diminish incrementally over the next four years. In 2010, Cornell University Library will subvent up to 75% of total annual costs; in 2011, the amount will decline to 50%; in 2012 to 25%; and thereafter remain steady at 15% of the operating budget. The budget for 2010 is approximately $400,000 per year. We expect this amount to go up to 500,000 by 2012 due to necessary upgrades and enhancements. Costs associated with institutional support management are factored in as a percentage of annual support income. Cornell University Library will not realize a \"profit\" from this support model; any surplus accrued will be reinvested in arXiv or result in reduced rates.","title":"2.4 Operating principles"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#25-development-of-a-long-term-business-plan","text":"We realize that our business model needs to be responsive to the shifting ecology of scholarly publishing. As we continue to investigate long-term sustainability issues, our goal through this document is to articulate potential interim strategies. The sustainability scenario we propose represents a short-term strategy for the next three years. Our initial approach will be to collaborate with the libraries of the heaviest user institutions in the US and abroad in our effort to reposition arXiv as a vested online scholarly resource, an asset with shared benefits and accountability. Over the next few years we will develop a long-term business plan that provides a strategic framework to protect and increase the value of arXiv for those who use it. Ideally this will comprise a blend of ongoing underwriting from Cornell University Library and support from the academic library community and research centers. It might also include support from scholarly societies, an endowment, or funding agencies such as the NSF. We will strengthen existing collaborations (e.g. with the INSPIRE project of CERN, SLAC, DESY and Fermilab) and develop additional partnerships that allow arXiv to provide better services or to share the support burden. Advice from the Sustainability Advisory Group (see section 2.7 ) and other supporting institutions will be used in developing this long-term business plan.","title":"2.5 Development of a long-term business plan"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#26-alternative-revenue-sources","text":"In the process of investigating business models we have considered many options. For a good overview see the Ithaka report on Sustainability and Revenue Models for Online Academic Resources . Alternative revenue sources considered included: Requesting donations at time of submission \u2014 We have no plans to impose article processing charges or submission fees. Barrier-free submission and use is one of the founding principles of arXiv. We have considered requesting donations at time of submission but have concluded that such fundraising would incur greater overhead than the institutional support model, and would not engage our peer institutions. We also want to ensure broad international contributions to the repository without financial expectations from the authors. SCOAP3 \u2014 arXiv would potentially be a beneficiary of redirected funding administered by the Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics (SCOAP3) consortium. It's not clear, however, when this initiative will meet its annual funding goal of \u20ac10,000,000 ($14,120,000). It should also be noted that the SCOAP3 initiative is restricted to HEP and particle physics content only, which represents between 18% and 40% of submissions to arXiv (depending how broadly the subject area is construed). If SCOAP3 is successful it could potentially subvent a similar fraction of arXiv's operating costs.

This report defines sustainability as \"the ability to generate or gain access to the resources financial or otherwise needed to protect and increase the value of the content or service for those who use it.\" Therefore, keeping open access academic resources such as arXiv sustainable involves not only covering their costs but also continuing to enhance their value based on the needs of the user community. Such a financial commitment is likely to be beyond a single institution's resources. arXiv has been one of the most important disruptive innovations in scholarly communications since the advent of the Internet. Its preemptive dissemination model represented the first significant means to provide expedited access to scientific research well ahead of formal publication. It remains an exemplar in the open-access debate. arXiv is a primary destination site for both authors and readers in its core domains within physics and math. If a case can be made for any repository being community-supported, arXiv has to be at the top of the list. We believe that arXiv sustainability should be considered a shared investment in a culturally embedded resource that provides unambiguous value to a global network of science researchers.","title":"2.9 Why should my institution support arXiv?"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#3-technical-architecture","text":"The arXiv software was developed in-house at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Cornell over the past 18 years. The software is predominantly written in Perl with components that use Java, PHP and Python. Metadata and user information is stored in a MySQL database and Lucene is used to provide the search service. A key focus of software development has been to automate the operation of arXiv as much as possible, and continual improvement has been necessary to keep the administrative staff requirement from increasing as the number of incoming submissions has steadily increased. The three server machines that provide the main arXiv.org site are supported by Cornell's central IT organization with 24x7 support. Mirror sites are locally supported and receive updates daily.","title":"3. Technical Architecture"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#31-technical-plans-for-maintaining-and-advancing-arxiv","text":"While the underlying technology has been updated throughout its 18 year history, the system requires significant internal re-engineering to support an evolving technological landscape, increased growth and use, and to ensure the sustainability of the service. arXiv's success has relied upon a highly efficient use of both author and administrative effort, and has served its large and ever-growing user base with only a fixed-size skeletal staff. In this respect, it long anticipated many of the current \"Web 2.0\" and social networking trends: providing a framework in which a community of users can deposit, share and annotate content. It also helped initiate, and continues to play a leading role, in the growing movement for open access to scholarly literature. Improve submission system \u2014 We expect to roll out a complete revision of the arXiv submission system early in 2010. This will provide much improved user interaction during the submission process and will also streamline the workflow for moderators and administrators, giving much greater flexibility when handling submissions with technical or classification issues. Underpinning this new system are several infrastructural improvements which will facilitate later development and/or platform migration. Support for associated data and information objects \u2014 Digital data and associated multimedia information such as images and audio/video are becoming an integral part of scientific publications. To maintain its innovation role in scholarly communication, it is essential for arXiv to develop features in support of the deposit and archiving of supplementary information objects that are associated with a given paper. Scalable and expandable architecture for sustainability \u2014 The arXiv software has been developed in-house over many years and this has both benefits and burdens associated with it. To keep arXiv sustainable, it is important to re-engineer the software to layer arXiv-specific functionality over generic repository software. Creating a generalized architecture will facilitate efficient technology management processes and allow the implementation of digital preservation procedures and policies.","title":"3.1 Technical plans for maintaining and advancing arXiv"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#32-subject-area-coverage-and-expansion","text":"The Cornell University Library frequently receives requests to extend arXiv to include other subject areas. In recent years we have added the fields of quantitative biology, statistics and quantitative finance; requests currently under consideration include mechanics and some areas of engineering. Due to limited resources, we have adopted a measured approach to expansion because there is significant organizational and administrative effort required both to create and to maintain new subject areas. Adding a new subject area involves exploring the user-base and use characteristics pertaining to the subject area, establishing the necessary advisory committees, and recruiting moderators. Although arXiv.org is the central portal for scientific communication in some disciplines, it is neither feasible nor necessarily desirable to play that role in all disciplines. However, arXiv can provide a model for other communities through improved service to its existing dedicated user communities, and act as an essential component of a global networked scholarly communication system. We anticipate that system will become increasingly broad in its subject area coverage, and increasingly diverse in its component databases, repositories, and other online tools and services.","title":"3.2 Subject area coverage and expansion"},{"location":"about/reports/whitepaper.html#33-enduring-access","text":"The first element in our plan is to ensure the long-term sustainability of arXiv as a service. This requires a solid business plan to support maintenance and expansion of the system. The second element is digital preservation of arXiv content. Digital preservation refers to a range of managed activities to support the long-term maintenance of bitstreams to ensure that digital objects are usable (intact and readable), retaining all quantities of authenticity, accuracy, and functionality deemed to be essential when articles (and other associated materials) were ingested. Formats accepted by arXiv have been selected based on their archival value (TeX/LaTeX, PDF, HTML, OOXML) and the ability to process all source files is actively monitored. The underlying bits are protected by standard backup procedures at the Cornell campus and off-site backup facilities in New York City provide geographic redundancy. The complete content is replicated at our mirror sites around the world and additional managed tape backups are taken at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The Cornell University Library is developing an archival repository that will support preservation of critical content from institutional resources including arXiv. All arXiv documents, both in source and processed form, with be stored in this repository by the end of 2010. There will be ongoing incremental ingest of new material.

Photos Photographs are an important part of the arXiv visual brand. Our curated photo collection represent academic spaces, researchers, labs, and other research-related subject matter. Images of the Cornell and Cornell Tech campuses help create a sense of place, and portraiture humanizes the vast community of people who rely on arXiv. Go to the arXiv Photo Library Colorization We apply color washes to photos in our brand colors of Warm Grey, Bright Blue, Dark Blue, and (as in the example) Salmon. Type Overlays Photographs can be overlayed with a type treatment as seen here. Learn more on our Tagline page. Illustrations Illustrations are used to represent abstract concepts or stakeholder groups. The illustrative style we use is informal and friendly. It is not slick or polished, but emphasizes thrift and mission focus, with a touch of gentle humor. People are represented by stick figures with no gender or other identifying features. Our primary accent color for illustrations is Bright Blue. Go to the arXiv Illustration Library Portraits We stylize staff and other stakeholder portraits with a color wash and square crop.

Our logo is ready to help us share a consistent, intentional, and meaningful message about who we are with the world. That message is: arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science. The arXiv logo nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv\u2019s birth in the 90\u2019s, while also being boldly forward looking. The arms of the \u2018X\u2019 retain stylistic elements of the \u2018chi\u2019 in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo captures the spirit of arXiv\u2019s core value as a place of connection.

It showcases two primary brand colors: Dark Grey and Cornell Red. Alternate: Dark Mode On a dark background, the dark mode version can be used for greater contrast. Alternate: Colors The alternate salmon color can be used where Cornell Red wont work while remaining in the same warm color family. Single color versions can be used when a simpler, higher contrast version is needed such as single color print applications. Lockups and Extensions Lockups are used for internal arXiv projects with unique impact and a need for distinct branding, or for pre-approved partnership use. Logo extensions are created on a custom basis for distinct projects, like arXiv Check. Exclusion Zone A clear area around the logo prevents any nearby graphic elements from interfering with the name\u2019s impact. The primary logo configuration should maintain spacing around the logo equal to the height of the \u2018a\u2019, as shown. The lockup configuration should maintain spacing around the logo equal to the height of the \u2018a\u2019, as shown. Logomarks arXiv's logomark is for use where space is at a premium and the full size logo cannot be used. These include mobile applications and when an icon is needed. Supergraphic arXiv's supergraphic provides a new twist on an old favorite: the arXiv \"smileybones\". Quirky, scrappy, inscrutable, and whaaaat? are just some of the ways this icon has been described over the years. The updated icon celebrates the pixelation of the original 90's image, and it's rebellious nature, with a modernized and high quality homage. For fun, here is a brief history of the original icon. The smileybones supergraphic should be used in applications where it can display on a large enough scale for impact, and where a bit of informality is appropriate, such as in the examples below.","title":"Logos"},{"location":"brand/logos.html#logos","text":"Our identifying mark, vetted and approved by Cornell University, achieves the legibility, memorability and legal defensibility arXiv needs.

It always begins with \"arXiv connects\" in a semi-bold weight, with the second line starting in lowercase and in a regular weight. The text is always highlighted in a bold black, with two pixels of spacing between the highlighted lines. No punctuation is ever used. The second line is flexible. But it should always be short, and directly address an audience that arXiv has a connection with. The font used is Freight Sans Pro (in Google applications, use Catamaran. When other fonts are not available default to Arial). The text color is Light Warm Grey over a black background. Taline Examples In this example the tagline is layered over a large, colorized photo for impact. The black highlight allows the tagline to retain legibility over even very busy backgrounds. Note the correct line break after 'arXiv connects'. Here, the tagline breaks the grid established by other elements on the page. In this layout, the tagline follows the established grid, while the photo breaks the grid. The tagline is most often, though not exclusively, overlayed on top of a photographic image that bleeds of one or more edges. Photos can add further context, build a sense of place, and reinforce the tagline message. The tagline is used in our Membership Newsletter header. By changing the context of the second line arXiv can draw attention to the specific idea being conveyed, or celebrate a particular audience.

The ACM classification scheme provides us with a relatively stable scheme that covers all of computer science. The subject areas are not mutually exclusive, nor do they (yet) provide complete coverage of the field. On the other hand, we hope that they better reflect the active areas of research in CS. We expect to add more subject areas and subdivide current subject areas according to demand. Authors who cannot find an appropriate subject area should use subject area Other. We welcome constructive comments and suggestions . AI - Artificial Intelligence - Diego Calvanese, Julien Corman, and Ognjen Savkovic Covers all areas of AI except Vision, Robotics, Machine Learning, Multiagent Systems, and Computation and Language (Natural Language Processing), which have separate subject areas. In particular, includes Expert Systems, Theorem Proving (although this may overlap with Logic in Computer Science), Knowledge Representation, Planning, and Uncertainty in AI. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes I.2.0, I.2.1, I.2.3, I.2.4, I.2.8, and I.2.11. CC - Computational Complexity - Christopher Umans Covers models of computation, complexity classes, structural complexity, complexity tradeoffs, upper and lower bounds. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes F.1 (computation by abstract devices), F.2.3 (tradeoffs among complexity measures), and F.4.3 (formal languages), although some material in formal languages may be more appropriate for Logic in Computer Science. Some material in F.2.1 and F.2.2, may also be appropriate here, but is more likely to have Data Structures and Algorithms as the primary subject area. CG - Computational Geometry - Kevin Buchin, Jeff Erickson Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes I.3.5 and F.2.2. CE - Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science - Paolo Bientinesi Covers applications of computer science to the mathematical modeling of complex systems in the fields of science, engineering, and finance. Papers here are interdisciplinary and applications-oriented, focusing on techniques and tools that enable challenging computational simulations to be performed, for which the use of supercomputers or distributed computing platforms is often required. Includes material in ACM Subject Classes J.2, J.3, and J.4 (economics). CL - Computation and Language (Computational Linguistics and Natural Language and Speech Processing) ( subsumes cmp-lg ) - Stuart Shieber Covers natural language processing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Class I.2.7. Note that work on artificial languages (programming languages, logics, formal systems) that does not explicitly address natural-language issues broadly construed (natural-language processing, computational linguistics, speech, text retrieval, etc.) is not appropriate for this area. CV - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition - David Forsyth Covers image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, and scene understanding. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes I.2.10, I.4, and I.5. CY - Computers and Society - Aylin Caliskan Covers impact of computers on society, computer ethics, information technology and public policy, legal aspects of computing, computers and education. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes K.0, K.2, K.3, K.4, K.5, and K.7. CR - Cryptography and Security - Jeremiah Blocki Covers all areas of cryptography and security including authentication, public key cryptosytems, proof-carrying code, etc. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes D.4.6 and E.3. DB - Databases - H.V. Jagadish Covers database management, datamining, and data processing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes E.2, E.5, H.0, H.2, and J.1. DS - Data Structures and Algorithms - David Eppstein Covers data structures and analysis of algorithms. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes E.1, E.2, F.2.1, and F.2.2. DL - Digital Libraries - Michael Lesk Covers all aspects of the digital library design and document and text creation. Note that there will be some overlap with Information Retrieval (which is a separate subject area). Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes H.3.5, H.3.6, H.3.7, I.7. DM - Discrete Mathematics - Jeff Erickson, Marcin Pilipczuk Covers combinatorics, graph theory, applications of probability. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes G.2 and G.3. DC - Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing - Shlomi Dolev Covers fault-tolerance, distributed algorithms, stabilility, parallel computation, and cluster computing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes C.1.2, C.1.4, C.2.4, D.1.3, D.4.5, D.4.7, E.1. ET - Emerging Technologies - Igor Markov, Dmitri Maslov Covers approaches to information processing (computing, communication, sensing) and bio-chemical analysis based on alternatives to silicon CMOS-based technologies, such as nanoscale electronic, photonic, spin-based, superconducting, mechanical, bio-chemical and quantum technologies (this list is not exclusive). Topics of interest roughly correspond to the \" Hardware/Emerging Technologies \" branch of the 2012 ACM Computing Classification and include (1) building blocks for emerging technologies, their scalability and adoption in larger systems, including integration with traditional technologies, (2) modeling, design and optimization of novel devices and systems, (3) models of computation, algorithm design and programming for emerging technologies. Note: papers on wireless networks should be submitted to cs.NI. For work on cloud computing, consider cs.DC, cs.AR, cs.NI or cs.CE, depending on the focus. For watermarking, consider cs.MM and cs.CR. FL - Formal Languages and Automata Theory - Michael Domaratzki Covers automata theory, formal language theory, grammars, and combinatorics on words. This roughly corresponds to ACM Subject Classes F.1.1, and F.4.3. Papers dealing with computational complexity should go to cs.CC; papers dealing with logic should go to cs.LO.

The ACM classification scheme provides us with a relatively stable scheme that covers all of computer science. The subject areas are not mutually exclusive, nor do they (yet) provide complete coverage of the field. On the other hand, we hope that they better reflect the active areas of research in CS. We expect to add more subject areas and subdivide current subject areas according to demand. Authors who cannot find an appropriate subject area should use subject area Other. We welcome constructive comments and suggestions .

This can be used to include extra files linked from an HTML submission. Declaring the top-level (parent) TeX file It is very rarely necessary to do this explicitly because arXiv employs a series of heuristics which can usually determine the top-level file. For example, if only one of a set of LaTeX files contains a \\documentclass command, that file is very likely the top-level file.

The article identifier scheme used by arXiv was changed in April 2007. All existing articles retain their original identifiers but newly announced articles have identifiers following the new scheme . As of January 2015, the number of digits used in the second part of the new identifier, the sequence number within the month, is increased from 4 to 5. This will allow arXiv to handle more than 9999 submissions per month (see monthly submission rates ). Identifier scheme since 1 April 2007 (0704-) All new articles have identifiers with the following form: arXiv:YYMM.number e.g. arXiv:1501.00001 or arXiv:0706.0001 where identifiers up to month 1412 are zero-padded to 4-digits in the last block, and those from 1501 onward are zero-padded to 5-digits. Specific versions are referred to by adding the version number: arXiv:YYMM.numbervV e.g. arXiv:1501.00001v1 or arXiv:0706.0001v2 In general, the form is arXiv:YYMM.number{vV} , where YY is the two-digit year (07=2007 through 99=2099, and potentially up to 06=2106) MM is the two-digit month number (01=Jan,...12=Dec) number is a zero-padded sequence number of 4- or 5-digits. From 0704 through 1412 it is 4-digits, starting at 0001 . From 1501 on it is 5-digits, starting at 00001 . 5-digits permits up to 99999 submissions per month. We cannot currently anticipate more than 99999 submissions per month although extension to 6-digits would be possible. vV is a literal v followed by a version number of 1 or more digits starting at v1 . Note that the identifier no longer contains any classification information and thus reclassification after an article is announced is possible. Classification information is indicated in other ways. For example, the stamp added to the side of the PDF versions of arXiv articles has the form: arXiv:0706.0001v1 [q-bio.CB] 1 Jun 2007 which indicates v1 of the article arXiv:0706.0001 which has primary classification q-bio.CB , and was submitted on 1 June 2007. The identifier arXiv:YYMM.numbervV provides a complete and unique citation for an arXiv article. Without the version number (e.g. arXiv:YYMM.number ), the identifier refers to the most recent version of the article. We recommend that in citations the specific version number, the subject classification and the date information be included in the same way that it is in the stamp on the side of the PDF. See also References to and in arXiv Documents . Identifiers up to March 2007 (9107-0703) Identifiers from 1991 through 2007-03 followed the form shown in the image below. The full list of groups, archives and subject classes is listed on the front page : Subject classes do not exist for some of the older archives in the Physics group. Instead, each archive represents a subject class, e.g., hep-ex , hep-lat , hep-ph , and hep-th . The astro-ph archive currently has no subject classes, while cond-mat and physics are classified by subject classes that appear only in the metadata (not in the identifier). This scheme uses two upper-case characters to identify the subject class, e.g., math (Geometric Topology) = math.GT , cs (Software Engineering) = cs.SE , and nlin (Chaotic Dynamics) = nlin.CD . Motivation for 2007 change of identifier scheme Some change to the arXiv identifier scheme was needs to permit submissions expected to exceed 1000 articles per month in some archives in 2007 (likely math , cond-mat and astro-ph ). The old identifier scheme imposed a limit of 999 submissions per month in any one archive. Obviously, we could have just added an extra digit ( arch-ive/YYMMNNNN ) or perhaps made the NNN alphanumeric. However, we took the opportunity to address other issues too. The primary motivation for removing subject-classification information from the identifier was to decouple these two properties (identification and classification). This will increase our flexibility to adjust the classifications of individual articles as necessary (for example, it has long been possible to adjust classification of articles within the cs and math archives and we see this as beneficial). It also makes it easier to adjust our classification schemes as disciplines and arXiv usage evolve (for example, we need to sub-divide astro-ph since it currently too large). Various schemes with optional or redundant classification information in the identifier were considered (extending from the redundant 2-letter subject classes in math etc.) but these were rejected because such many-to-1 resolution of identifier-to-article means that interacting services cannot compare identifiers and know whether they refer to the same arXiv article without local knowledge of arXiv's identifier scheme. We feel that is a useful to have a single canonical form for identifiers within a month, with the same number of digits following the period. Thus identifiers from 0704 through 1412 have the sequence number (the number following the period) padded to 4-digits. The use of 4-digits places a limit of 9999 identifiers in a single month and it is possible that this will be exceeded in 2015 (8871 articles in 1410, 8668 in 1409). To ensure that the canonical form changes at a convenient year-boundary the sequence number is padded to 5-digits from month 1501 onward, starting with identifier 1501.00001.

In the new scheme it is not be possible to tell the original primary classification from the identifier. However, both the primary and secondary classifications are given (definitively) for all articles by the Categories: in the metadata. Versioning. The versioning semantics are consistent across the different identifier schemes. An identifier with a version number appended refers to that specific version. An identifier without a version number refers to the article (a trackback, for example, is to a article and not to a particular version), and in appropriate contexts will resolve to the latest version (if supplied in an /abs/ URL for example). Extension. The new scheme could be extended to use more than 4 or 5 digits for the sequence number. However, that would correspond to more than 99999 submissions per month, or over 10 times the current submission rate, and is thus not anticipated for many years. Indications of classification The stamp added to the side of processed TeX submissions now shows the primary classification in a standard way, and is also recommended as the preferred citation format. Examples are: arXiv:hep-th/9901001v2 10 May 1999 arXiv:gr-qc/0606006v1 6 Jun 2006 arXiv:math/9901001v1 [math.GT] 1 Jan 1999 arXiv:cs/0001002v1 [cs.AR] 2 Jan 2000 arXiv:nlin/0201003v1 [nlin.AO] 3 Jan 2002 arXiv:q-bio/0401004v1 [q-bio.BM] 4 Jan 2004 arXiv:cond-mat/9901001v1 [cond-mat.supr-con] 1 Jan 1999 arXiv:physics/9901001v1 [physics.optics] 1 Jan 1999 arXiv:0706.0001v1 [cond-mat.soft] 1 Jun 2007 arXiv:0706.0002v3 [astro-ph] 15 Mar 2008 arXiv:1501.00001v1 [hep-th] 1 Jan 2015 Old papers in archives where the archive name matches the primary subject classification (e.g. hep-th ) do not have the square brackets with primary subject classification. In all other cases, the square brackets are added.

Contact us if there is a particular issue. 2007-04: The old functionality of accepting partial identifiers and displaying a form to enter remaining information has been removed. The following now show \"not found\" error messages: /abs/hep-th/01001 , /abs/hep-th/1 , /abs/hep-th . These facilities were very little used (a few accesses per week) and most accesses appeared to be mistakes.

It would also permit construction of an author-article graph which is useful for relevance assessment and bibliometric analysis. Since 2005 arXiv has used authority records that associate user accounts with articles authored by that user. These records support the endorsement system . The use of public author identifiers as a way to build services upon this data is new in 2009. Initially, users must opt-in to have a public author identifier and to expose the record of their articles on arXiv for use in other services. At some later date we hope to be able to improve our authority records to the point where we can create public author identifiers for all authors of arXiv articles without needing to enlist the help of each author to check their record before opting in.

We must balance the desire to promote research and development based on the arXiv collection against these constraints. Access mechanisms provided are grouped into metadata and full-text services below. Please review the Terms of Use for arXiv APIs before using any of the access options below. Bulk Metadata Access OAI-PMH arXiv supports the OAI protocol for metadata harvesting (OAI-PMH) to provide access to metadata for all articles, updated daily with new articles. This is the preferred way to bulk-download or keep an up-to-date copy of arXiv metadata. API arXiv supports real-time programmatic access to metadata and our search engine via the arXiv API . Results are returned using the Atom XML format for easy integration with web services and toolkits. RSS arXiv provides RSS feeds of new updates each day. These are intended primarily for human consumption but do use well defined XML formats and thus might be useful to machine applications. Bulk Full-Text Access Note: Most articles submitted to arXiv are submitted with the default arXiv license which grants arXiv a perpetual, non-exclusive license to distribute the article, but does not assign copyright to arXiv, nor grant arXiv the right to grant any specific rights to others. We are thus unable to grant others the right to distribute arXiv articles. If you build indexes or tools based on the full-text, you must link back to arXiv for downloads. A small fraction of submissions are made with other licenses and this information is available in the OAI-PMH metadata. Kaggle The full, machine-readable arXiv dataset is available on Kaggle . This includes all available articles and related features such as article titles, authors, categories, abstracts, full text PDFs, and more. Amazon S3 For all available articles the processed PDF and source files are available from Amazon S3 . KDD cup dataset A sample of arXiv source files was collected in 2003 for the KDD cup competition. This dataset may be downloaded from the KDD cup website . This dataset also includes extracted citation data. Custom Programmatic Harvesting As stated on our robots page, arXiv has limited server capacity and our first priority is to support interactive use by human users. That said, we are plainly aware that interested parties will want to make use of our corpus. Play nice We ask that users intent on harvesting use the dedicated site export.arxiv.org for these purposes, which contains an up-to-date copy of the corpus and is specifically set aside for programmatic access. This will mitigate impact on readers who are using the main site interactively. There are many users who want to make use of our data, and millions of distinct URLs behind our site. If everyone were to crawl the site at once without regard to a reasonable request rate, the site could be dragged down and unusable. For these purposes we suggest that a reasonable rate to be bursts at 4 requests per second with a 1 second sleep , per burst. Consider the impact arXiv already operates with limited resources, and mindlessly downloading all of the URLs of this site will return terabytes of data. This represents both a financial burden to arXiv, as well as a practical problem for the unwary. Please do not attempt to download the complete corpus programmatically. The Amazon S3 buckets are the accepted mechanism to download the complete corpus, but you are welcome to \"play catch-up\" programmatically between updates of the buckets.","title":"arXiv Bulk Data Access"},{"location":"help/bulk_data.html#arxiv-bulk-data-access","text":"We believe that open access should permit computation on collections of articles as well as human access to individual articles, and that the results of such computation will include better tools to find, browse, use and assess articles.

It must be told what types of files to expect and what to do with them when it gets them. In some cases, you may need to know the appropriate MIME types delivered by arXiv . Delivery of Compressed Formats (PostScript, DVI, source) Note that PostScript, DVI, and source files are delivered in gzip compressed format (a standard compression method). Submissions consisting of several files are bundled together in a single tar file before being gzipped. Downloaded PS, DVI, and source files must therefore first be gunzipped, and then possibly untarred. See our unpacking notes for more information. Depending on how your web browser is configured, it may uncompress the downloaded file(s) automatically. This may present a problem if the browser does not then properly rename the formerly gunzipped file. In these cases, users will complain that the downloaded file will not gunzip. See Downloaded .gz Files that are not Gzipped for a explanation of the problem. PostScript As stated above, arXiv delivers PostScript in gzipped format. We sometimes receive complaints that the compressed PostScript articles do not uncompress, or that is, it seems they do not, as the downloaded files can be viewed unproblematically if first saved to disk. See Downloaded .gz Files that are not Gzipped for a explanation of the problem. There are many standard programs available to view PostScript documents. We highly recommend the Ghostscript suite of tools , which is freely available at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost for most common operating systems. After installation, you will want to assign the PostScript MIME type with the appropriate viewer either via a download wizard (prompts which program you'd like to associate with this filetype at download time) or through the appropriate menu option (e.g., Edit->Preferences->Downloads in Firefox). PDF The most common programs used to view PDF are: Adobe's free Acrobat Reader (also known as \"acroread\" on Linux/Unix systems), available on most platforms Apple's Preview, which comes preinstalled on Mac systems and preconfigured in the Safari browser xpdf , an open source viewer freely available for Linux/Unix platforms After installation, you will want to assign the PDF MIME type with the appropriate viewer either via a download wizard (prompts which program you'd like to associate with this filetype at download time) or through the appropriate menu option (e.g., Edit->Preferences->Downloads in Firefox). Source The source files for a paper are sent as a single compressed file. For papers without figures, this file is just the gzipped TeX/LaTeX source file. If the paper has several parts (e.g., LaTeX plus multiple figures), they will be bundled together in a single gzipped tar file for downloading. See our unpacking notes . Most Unix/Linux web browsers will uncompress gzipped files but not untar them. Thus for multi-part files you need to use the tar command to unpack individual TeX and PostScript files from the single file you download. On Windows and Macintosh you will probably need to both uncompress and untar, because browsers on these platforms typically will not uncompress automatically.

The information below is specific to display of submitter and author email. Submitter Email Over the years, arXiv has occasionally received complaints from submitters regarding unsolicited physics-related e-mails apparently prompted by their submissions.

E-mail addresses may also be harvested by e-mail viruses from browser caches and mail spools, and then diffused further in falsified From: lines. Measures are now in place at arXiv to protect the e-mail addresses of submitters from abuse. For example, submitter addresses are no longer visible on the abstract page of a paper; the submitter's address is instead available on a link that says [view email] . Access to this link requires one to logon, or first to register .

The intent of this and other technical measures now in place is to make it difficult or impossible to harvest large numbers of e-mail addresses with minimal inconvenience to users who need a single address for legitimate communication purposes. Why does arXiv make e-mail addresses available? arXiv allows registered users to view the email address that was used to upload each submission to arXiv.

Users that view a large number of email addresses in a short period of time are typically collecting email addresses for the promotion of an event, service or concept, and this is an inappropriate use of the contact information for other users. arXiv is committed to protecting its users from spam and other misuses of personal information that is collected in the course of operating arXiv.org.

Why does arXiv require endorsement? arXiv is distinct from the web as a whole, because arXiv contains exclusively scientific content. The endorsement system verifies that arXiv contributors belong to the scientific community in a fair and sustainable way that can scale with arXiv's future growth. arXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly papers in specific scientific disciplines. Material submitted to arXiv is expected to be of interest, relevance, and value to those disciplines. Endorsement is a necessary but not sufficient condition to have papers accepted in arXiv; arXiv reserves the right to reject or reclassify any submission. The endorsement system ensures that arXiv content is relevant to current research at much lower cost than conventional peer-reviewed journals, so we can continue to offer free access to the scientific community and the general public. Although our system may be imperfect, people who fail to get endorsement are still free to post articles on their web site or to submit their publications to peer-reviewed journals. How can I get endorsed? arXiv may give some people automatic endorsements based on subject area, topic, previous submissions, and academic affiliation. In most cases, automatic endorsement is given to authors from known academic institutions and research facilities. arXiv submitters are therefore encouraged to associate an institutional email address, if they have one, with their arXiv account (see author registration help ). This will expedite the endorsement process. During the submission process, however, we may require authors who are submitting papers to a subject category for the first time to get an endorsement from an established arXiv author. Detailed instructions on how to proceed with the endorsement request are provided at that time. If you need to be endorsed by someone, it is best for you to find an endorser who you know personally and is knowledgeable in the subject area of your paper. A good choice for graduate students would be your thesis advisor or another professor in your department/institution working in your field. Alternatively this is the recommended way to proceed. Start by finding related articles in your field. Your preprint surely has cited works that are already posted in the arXiv, some of these works will be particularly relevant. Bring up these abstracts from the arXiv page. You can find somebody qualified to endorse by clicking on the link titled \"Which of these authors are endorsers?\" at the bottom of every abstract page. Using that information, you can then find the email address of the submitter on the abstract page just under the \"Submission history\" heading. It is a good idea to send eligible endorsers a copy of your proposed submission along with the endorsement request. Please note, however, that it is inappropriate to email large numbers of potential endorsers at once, or to repeatedly email the same endorser with a request for endorsement. At least one positive endorsement is required per endorsement domain to be considered endorsed for that domain. The number of positive endorsements, however, must exceed the number of negative endorsements. In other words, you must maintain a net positive endorsement per domain to be considered endorsed. Therefore, you should consider carefully to whom you make endorsement requests. arXiv reserves the right to revoke any submitter's endorsement if that submitter has violated arXiv policies. Who can endorse? Endorsers must have authored a certain number of papers within the endorsement domain of a subject area. The number of papers depends on the particular subject area, but has been set so that any active scientist who has been working in their field for a few years should be able to endorse if their work has been submitted to arXiv and if they are registered as an author of their papers. Endorsement domains have been chosen to reflect related subject areas and ensure that it will be easy for people to find endorsements: most high-level subject areas (e.g., hep-th, cond-mat, q-bio) are currently endorsement domains, with the notable exception of physics, in which individual subject classes (e.g., phys.acc-phys, phys.med-ph) are endorsement domains. To ensure that endorsers are active members of the community, we only count papers that have been submitted between three months and five years ago.* If you would like to be able to endorse, the most important thing that you can do is make sure that you are registered as an author of your papers. If you can get the paper password for a paper you can claim ownership of a paper immediately. If you don't have the paper password, you can request ownership of a paper. Note that you must also have an active positive endorsement to that area yourself before you may endorse for that subject classification. * We reserve the right to suspend a person's ability to endorse. What are my responsibilities as an endorser? The endorsement process is not peer review. You should know the person that you endorse or you should see the paper that the person intends to submit. We don't expect you to read the paper in detail, or verify that the work is correct, but you should check that the paper is appropriate for the subject area. You should not endorse the author if the author is unfamiliar with the basic facts of the field, or if the work is entirely disconnected with current work in the area. If you are sent a paper to read, you should treat that content as privileged information and respect its confidentiality as you would if you were asked to review it for a journal. If an author asks you for endorsement, they will send you a six-character alphanumeric endorsement code . After you enter this code on the endorsement form , you can tell us that you do or do not wish to endorse a person. If you wish to abstain from the endorsement process altogether, do not submit anything on the endorsement form. If you choose not to endorse a author, you should use the endorsement form to explicitly tell us that you do not wish to endorse this person, and this will be recorded as a negative vote of endorsement. The fact that you have personally endorsed or not endorsed a person (as well as any optional comments) is private between you and the arXiv administrators \u2013 this information will not be shared with arXiv users or the person requesting endorsement, although under certain circumstances an author might be able to infer your action. If you feel uncomfortable about endorsing an author for any reason, do not do it \u2013 ask the person to find another endorser. Only provide endorsement to authors seeking to submit their own work, not to third-parties or proxies.","title":"Endorsement"},{"location":"help/endorsement.html#the-arxiv-endorsement-system","text":"Since January 17, 2004 arXiv has required that users be endorsed before submitting their first paper to a category or subject class.","title":"The arXiv endorsement system"},{"location":"help/endorsement.html#why-does-arxiv-require-endorsement","text":"arXiv is distinct from the web as a whole, because arXiv contains exclusively scientific content.

The number of papers depends on the particular subject area, but has been set so that any active scientist who has been working in their field for a few years should be able to endorse if their work has been submitted to arXiv and if they are registered as an author of their papers. Endorsement domains have been chosen to reflect related subject areas and ensure that it will be easy for people to find endorsements: most high-level subject areas (e.g., hep-th, cond-mat, q-bio) are currently endorsement domains, with the notable exception of physics, in which individual subject classes (e.g., phys.acc-phys, phys.med-ph) are endorsement domains. To ensure that endorsers are active members of the community, we only count papers that have been submitted between three months and five years ago.* If you would like to be able to endorse, the most important thing that you can do is make sure that you are registered as an author of your papers. If you can get the paper password for a paper you can claim ownership of a paper immediately. If you don't have the paper password, you can request ownership of a paper. Note that you must also have an active positive endorsement to that area yourself before you may endorse for that subject classification. * We reserve the right to suspend a person's ability to endorse.","title":"Who can endorse?"},{"location":"help/endorsement.html#what-are-my-responsibilities-as-an-endorser","text":"The endorsement process is not peer review. You should know the person that you endorse or you should see the paper that the person intends to submit. We don't expect you to read the paper in detail, or verify that the work is correct, but you should check that the paper is appropriate for the subject area. You should not endorse the author if the author is unfamiliar with the basic facts of the field, or if the work is entirely disconnected with current work in the area. If you are sent a paper to read, you should treat that content as privileged information and respect its confidentiality as you would if you were asked to review it for a journal. If an author asks you for endorsement, they will send you a six-character alphanumeric endorsement code . After you enter this code on the endorsement form , you can tell us that you do or do not wish to endorse a person. If you wish to abstain from the endorsement process altogether, do not submit anything on the endorsement form. If you choose not to endorse a author, you should use the endorsement form to explicitly tell us that you do not wish to endorse this person, and this will be recorded as a negative vote of endorsement. The fact that you have personally endorsed or not endorsed a person (as well as any optional comments) is private between you and the arXiv administrators \u2013 this information will not be shared with arXiv users or the person requesting endorsement, although under certain circumstances an author might be able to infer your action.

Authors are welcome to download copies of their own articles from arXiv in order to submit to a local repository. This page describes ways in which institutional repository managers may approach finding and copying local researchers' content from arXiv. Copying content from arXiv to an IR Some institutions require or request that copies of articles written by their researchers are deposited in their local institutional repository in addition to arXiv. Everything necessary to pull complete metadata and fulltext from arXiv is available. However, the usual sticking point is the permission required to copy the fulltext into the institutional repository: arXiv does not have the right to grant such permission so in the general case permission must be obtained from the article authors. Obtaining permission from the article authors may not be necessary if: there is a license permitting such copying associated with the article. The default arXiv license simply grants arXiv the right to distribute the article but does not authorize reposting in another repository. Licenses such as the Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY) or the Public Domain Dedication do permit such reposting (see arXiv License Information for information about licenses supported). there is some local rule or law that permits copying local researchers' articles into an institutional repository. Procedure We will consider the article arXiv:1410.6579 as an example. Step 1 - Get metadata Metadata from arXiv is available via our OAI-PMH interface , the URI for different metadata formats is constructed based on the article identifier. For example, to get oai_dc metadata the request is: http://export.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:1410.6579&metadataPrefix=oai_dc or to get arXiv format metadata, which has the license information expressed as a URI, the request is: http://export.arxiv.org/oai2?verb=GetRecord&identifier=oai:arXiv.org:1410.6579&metadataPrefix=arXiv Step 2 - Check the license In the case of arXiv:1410.6579 the license is the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication which is represented in the arXiv format metadata as: ... <license>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/</license> ... The Public Domain Dedication allows and article to be copied to another repository without the need to ask for permission. Most submissions to arXiv use the default license however, expressed with the URI: ... <license>http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/</license> ... In these cases it is necessary to obtain permission from the article authors before the article may be copied to another repository. Step 3 - Copy the PDF and/or source files In the case of arXiv:1410.6579 the submission was in PDF format and the URI to download it is: PDF: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6579 In all cases links to the processed and the source files (where the submission is in TeX format) are provided on the normal abstract page (e.g. arXiv:1306.1073 ), they may also be constructed from the article identifier. PDF: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.1073 Source: http://arxiv.org/src/1306.1073 See arXiv identifier scheme - information for interacting services and Media types delivered by arXiv for further technical details. If you want to download just a few articles then there should be no problem provided a useful User-Agent string is sent in the HTTP requests, or if requests are made manually through a normal web browser. If you would like to download a significant number of articles then accesses should be spaced by at least 3 seconds to avoid our denial-of-service attack detector cutting off access, please contact arXiv support if you intend to download more than a thousand articles. Identifying articles by your institution's researchers Unfortunately, most arXiv articles do not have any affiliation information included by submitters, and when it is present there is wide variation in the writing of institution names which makes matching difficult. However, arXiv does maintain authority records linking articles to author accounts. This linkage is automatic for the submitting author but co-authors must claim-ownership after announcement in order to be linked. Additionally, user accounts may be linked with ORCID iDs and then a public display of all arXiv articles linked to that ORCID iD is available on arXiv in both human an machine-readable forms. With these linkages in place, if you know the ORCID iDs of your institutions' researchers it is then possible to find all their articles on arXiv. The ability to link arXiv accounts with ORCID iDs was introduced in early 2015 and we suggest that institutions interested in identifying articles by their researchers encourage both claiming article ownership and ORCID iD linkage. Example Consider the article arXiv:1505.00009 which was submitted by first author Jonathan Heckman. Ownership was later claimed by co-author David R. Morrison who has also associated his ORCID iD with his arXiv account. If staff at UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), where David R. Morrison is faculty, wanted to find papers on arXiv but UCSB researchers they could query based on ORCID iDs. David's ORCID iD is http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6286-1277 and one can query arXiv using a URI of the form http://arxiv.org/a/ORCID , putting either the full URI or just the 16-digit part of the ORCID iD in place of ORCID , e.g.: http://arxiv.org/a/http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6286-1277 or http://arxiv.org/a/0000-0001-6286-1277 If accessed in a web browser these URIs return HTML pages.

As such, arXiv keeps a permanent record of every submission and replacement announced. arXiv does not ask that copyright be transferred. However, we require sufficient rights to allow us to distribute submitted articles in perpetuity. In order to submit an article to arXiv, the submitter must either: grant arXiv.org a non-exclusive and irrevocable license to distribute the article , and certify that the submitter has the right to grant this license; certify that the work is available under one of the following Creative Commons licenses and that the submitter has the right to assign this license: Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY 4.0) Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY-SA 4.0) Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) ; or dedicate the work to the public domain by associating the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0 1.0) with the submission. In the most common case, authors have the right to grant these licenses because they hold copyright in their own work. We currently support three of the Creative Commons licenses . If you wish to use a different CC license, then select arXiv's non-exclusive license to distribute in the arXiv submission process and indicate the desired Creative Commons license in the actual article. Note: if you intend to submit, or have submitted, your article to a journal then you should verify that the license you select during arXiv submission does not conflict with the journal's license or copyright transfer agreement. Many journal agreements permit submission to arXiv using the non-exclusive license to distribute , which arXiv has used since 2004. Yet the CC BY and CC BY-SA licenses permit commercial reuse and may therefore conflict with some journal agreements. Metadata license To the extent that the depositor or arxiv has a copyright interest in metadata accompanying the submission, a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication will apply. Authority to submit arXiv cannot accept papers that contain material for which the depositor does not have the authority to submit or to agree to the license terms. This would include comments by referees (which may have separate copyright protection) and, of course, plagiarized material. Note that any single co-author normally has all needed authority to submit a paper to arXiv. Once publicly available, articles cannot be entirely removed, either at the request of the submitting author or of any co-author. Licenses granted are irrevocable Authors should take care to upload an article only if they are certain that they will not later wish to publish it in a journal that prohibits prior distribution on an e-print server. arXiv will not remove an announced article to comply with such a journal policy -- the license granted on submission is irrevocable. However, granting rights for arXiv to distribute an article does not preclude later copyright assignment. Authors are thus free to publish submissions that already appear on arXiv. Authors may wish to inform the journal publisher that a prior non-exclusive license exists before transferring copyright or granting a publication license. Please check the policies of any potential publication venue before uploading to arXiv. (For the policy information of many publishers, see the SHERPA/RoMEO site.) Copyright notices It is usually the case that PDFs found on publisher websites or supplied as proofs are the property of the publisher, which often owns the copyright and/or licenses their use. Submission of PDFs with copyright statements which prohibit or impair arXiv's redistribution license will be rejected. If explicit permission is given for open access redistribution, these are permissible. Users should contact arXiv administrators at help@arxiv.org if they have questions. If you have permission from a publisher to upload content to arXiv provided that you include a special copyright statement with the paper, the correct place for that statement is the first page of the text of the submission.

MathJax is a javascript display engine for rendering $\\TeX$ or MathML-coded mathematics in browsers without requiring font installation or browser plug-ins. Any modern browser with javascript enabled will be MathJax-ready. For general information about MathJax, visit mathjax.org . Below are questions and answers about the use of MathJax on arXiv. Where is MathJax being used on arXiv? We have enabled MathJax on this help page, article abstract and list pages, the user account page, the submission preview page and search result pages. On these pages, MathJax has been configured to render inline ( $-enclosed ) $\\TeX$ only. For example, the expression $P(E) = {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k}$ will be rendered as $P(E) = {n \\choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k}$ . MathML is not supported in arXiv's MathJax configuration. In general, MathJax will only attempt to render $\\TeX$ in the article title, abstract and comments fields. How do I know if MathJax is being used on an arXiv page? MathJax-enabled pages may briefly display a small box to indicate that the MathJax configuration is being loaded, regardless of whether there is any renderable $\\TeX$ on the page. Valid $\\TeX$ expressions will be displayed by MathJax as the page is being loaded. On abstract pages, any $\\TeX$ expressions that MathJax cannot render will be displayed in their original text. On the user account and submission preview pages, rendering errors or unknown macros are displayed in red. For example: $\\invalid_TeX$ . Can I see the underlying $\\TeX$ coding? Yes, to access the underlying $\\TeX$ , right- or control-click on a rendered math formula, and choose the format you want from the Format sub-menu. Then select the Show Source menu item to get a pop-up that allows you to copy the math source into another application. To try this feature, visit https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/test/sample-dynamic.html . Alternatively, MathJax can be disabled entirely (see below). Can I disable MathJax? Yes, you can disable (and re-enable) MathJax by clicking the following link to set a cookie: Disable MathJax When MathJax is disabled, mathematical expressions are displayed as text with the original $\\TeX$ delimiters. Note that on any particular MathJax-enabled page in arXiv, not all expressions may be renderable. So turning MathJax on or off may have no effect on the visual appearance of certain math expressions. As an arXiv submitter, how can I make the best use of MathJax? MathJax supports a very large subset of $\\TeX$ mathematics, including AMS math and symbols. arXiv's implementation of MathJax does not support user-defined macros. For example, if an abstract contains $\\rtwo$ as a shortcut for $\\mathbf{R}\\^2$ , then MathJax will not be able to render this expression. Submitters should use only standard La$\\TeX$ and AMS-La $\\TeX$ macros in paper titles and abstracts. Also, since '<' is a reserved character in HTML, special care must be taken in its use. Usually just adding a space after it will suffice for it not to be interpreted as the start of an element name (e.g., 'x < y', not 'x<y'); but if in doubt, use the entity reference '<'. Where can I get help regarding MathJax? The MathJax web site has useful information about browser configuration, fonts, MathJax features, etc. Please see the MathJax documentation and the FAQ if you have questions.

In the following we list the delivery types and their associated Content-Type headers. Any file types not listed here will use standard media type headers (e.g. text/html for HTML). PDF (pdf) PDF is delivered as a plain PDF file (not gzipped) with content type application/pdf , e.g.: > curl -# -I http://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00001v1.pdf | grep Content-Type Content-Type: application/pdf PostScript (ps) PostScript is delivered as a gzipped PostScript file with both Content-Type and Content-Encoding headers, e.g: > curl -# -I http://arxiv.org/ps/adap-org/9708007v1 | grep -p 'Content-[TE]' Content-Type: application/postscript Content-Encoding: x-gzip Source files arXiv supports two different URI patterns for accessing source files, /e-print/ID and /src/ID . The /e-print/ID form delivers a single file with the appropriate content type for single-file submission, or a gzipped tar file for multiple source files (most TeX s ubmissions or multi-file PS). The /src/ID form always delivers a gzipped tar file. Multiple source files example Article arXiv:hep-lat/9107001 has multiple file TeX source.

While arXiv prides itself on maintaining a permanent collection of scientific work that is made available to the public quickly and without cost, submissions to arXiv do require a minimal amount of moderation. Why does arXiv moderate submissions? arXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly papers in specific scientific disciplines. Material submitted to arXiv is expected to be of interest, relevance, and value to those disciplines. arXiv reserves the right to reject or reclassify any submission. What policies guide moderation? arXiv moderation may result in the reclassification or removal of a submission. Reclassification by our moderators helps make sure that submissions are posted to the most appropriate archive. Cross-lists may be added to other related archives, or they may be removed by moderators when the classification is deemed inappropriate. A submission that is cross-listed to a category will still be announced in the mailings to that category. arXiv policies that could lead to the removal of a submission are: Unrefereeable content. arXiv only accepts submissions in the form of an article that would be refereeable by a conventional publication venue. Papers that do not contain original or substantive research, including undergraduate research, course projects, and research proposals, news, or information about political causes (even those with potential special interest to the academic community) may be removed. Papers that contain inflammatory or fictitious content, papers that use highly dramatic and misrepresentative titles/abstracts/introductions, or papers in need of significant review and revision may be removed. Inappropriate format. Abstract-only submissions, presentations, book announcements, book reviews, submissions without references, calls for papers, or advertisements may be removed. We do not accept submissions with line numbers or submissions with watermarks. Inappropriate topic. While arXiv serves a variety of scientific communities, not all subjects are currently covered. Submissions that do not fit well into our current classification scheme may be removed and, where possible, redirected to a more appropriate repository. Duplicated content. If moderators notice that a user has made many similar submissions in a short amount of time, or that a new submission appears to be a revision of a recent submission, then moderators may request that the submissions be consolidated. This helps ensure that arXiv is as useful as possible for all of the various communities publishing here, and it can often help the author present a more unified body of research. Rights to submit material. Submissions to arXiv must be the author\u2019s original work, and users must have the right to grant the rights contained in the selected license . Users must ensure the submission does not, to the best of their knowledge, infringe upon anyone's copyright. Users should not submit comments by referees. Users should not submit plagiarized material. Excessive submission rate. Articles submitted to arXiv must be of refereeable quality, and there is a practical limit to the rate at which appropriate, independent submissions can be produced by any one person. Moderators may request that a particular author limit their submission rate if this author has a history of many submissions to inappropriate areas or of doubtful refereeability. If an author has a back catalog of work to submit to arXiv we ask that they submit no more than three papers per day. Can I appeal a moderation decision? If you disagree with a moderation decision, you may submit an appeal. Please carefully follow the directions below. Send a precise email, including all relevant details (especially paper IDs, former correspondence, submission summaries, etc.) to moderation@arxiv.org. If you receive an automated response to your email, please read all instructions carefully. If there is no other identifying information in your message (e.g., paper ID or rejection ID), you may need to address your email with \"Dear arXiv-moderation,\" to bypass our SPAM filter. You will get an email from arXiv administrators when your appeal has been sent to our appellate moderators for consideration. Please be patient , as moderation appeals are complicated and take some time. When a decision is made by the appellate moderators you will receive a follow up message from arXiv administrators. Our moderators are not referees and do not provide detailed feedback on submissions. Administrators cannot provide detailed feedback regarding submissions deemed inappropriate and will not enter into extended discussion regarding submissions. In some cases, we may require that a paper be accepted for publication in a conventional journal before an appeal is considered. The appeals process allows moderators additional time to reconsider a submission, but repeated appeals with no additional information cannot be considered. If you send an appeal and the moderators reach the same decision as they did initially, no further appeal should be submitted. Extreme cases may be addressed to the appropriate advisory committee chair only: physics ; mathematics ; computer science (CoRR) ; quantitative biology ; quantitative finance ; statistics ; electrical engineering and systems science ; or economics . Who are arXiv moderators? arXiv moderators are volunteers who are experts in their fields and in the types of submissions that are appropriate for their subject classifications. They evaluate based on the content of the submission and the policies of arXiv. Moderators consider the submissions to arXiv as privileged information, as they would with a paper being refereed for a journal. arXiv moderators are approved by their discipline-level advisory committees and by arXiv staff. Although the moderators may be publicly acknowledged, it is inappropriate to contact any moderator directly regarding your submission. All communication about moderation decisions should be addressed to moderation@arxiv.org or, in extreme cases, the appropriate advisory committee chair. Moderators are encouraged not to reply to personal correspondence regarding arXiv submissions.","title":"arXiv moderation"},{"location":"help/moderation.html#arxiv-moderation","text":"arXiv is a forum for professional members of the scientific community.

To the right of this paragraph you should see an example of what this provides for arXiv user Simeon Warner . If you would like to use this functionality, you will need to link an ORCID identifier to your arXiv user account or create an arXiv public author identifier The quickstart section below will get you up and running rapidly; complete details follow the quickstart. Quickstart First, you will need to figure out where on the webpage you would like the arXiv atom feed information to be placed and add a <div id=\"arxivfeed\"></div> element. The arXiv data will be inserted into this element (you may include HTML inside this element which will be replaced when the data loads, for example this page has [Loading myarticles...] ). Next you will need to include the arXiv JavaScript that will access arXiv, retrieve the list of your articles, and then format and display the data on your page. Simply insert this: <script type=\"text/javascript\"> <!-- var arxiv_authorid = \"yourauthorid\"; //--></script> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://arxiv.org/js/myarticles.js\"></script> either in between the <head> and </head> tags or soon after the <body> tag in your web page. The first script entry provides configuration variables that controls what information is rendered on your web page. The only required element is the local part of your author id variable shown above as yourauthorid , such as 0000-0002-7970-7855 or warner_s_1. Make sure you leave the semicolon at the end of that line. When you're ready to go your html should look something like this: <html> <head> <title>Dr. Nate's Page of accomplishments</title> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> <!-- var arxiv_authorid = \"yourauthorid\"; //--></script> <style type=\"text/css\"> div.arxivfeed {margin-bottom: 5px; width:700px;} </style> <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://arxiv.org/js/myarticles.js\"> </script> </head> <body> <h1>Nate Rules!</h1> <p>Stuff goes here</p> <div id=\"arxivfeed\"></div> </body> </html> This will render the default feed using your authorid, as shown in the box below aligned to the right side of the page as an example. If you'd like to change how this looks, read about the configuration options below. You can also look at the HTML source of this page as a guide. This page is styled to use the sidebar display format, using a right floated div . Configuration options The myarticles JavaScript widget has a number of configuration options that you can set to control how the feed is rendered on your page. The table below contains the variable names, their meaning and the default settings. All arguments beside the arxiv_authorid variable are optional. Variable name What does it do? Allowed values Default value arxiv_authorid Determines the feed content String that represents the local part of the arXiv ORCID-based identifier or arXiv author identifier (i.e. the part after https://arxiv.org/a/). None arxiv_format Controls the overall format of the feed arxiv or pretty pretty arxiv_max_entries The maximum number of entries from the feed displayed Integer 0 or higher (0 means all) 10 arxiv_includeTitle If set to 1 displays the feed title 0 or 1 1 (show title) arxiv_includeSummary If set to 1 displays the summary/abstract for each article 0 or 1 0 (hide summary) arxiv_includeComments For arxiv_format = \"arxiv\". If set to 1 displays the comments field associated with each article. 0 or 1 1 (show comments) arxiv_includeSubjects For arxiv_format = \"arxiv\". If set to 1 displays the arXiv subject categories for each article. 0 or 1 1 (show subjects) arxiv_includeJournalRef For arxiv_format = \"arxiv\". If set to 1 displays any journal reference associated with an article. 0 or 1 1 (show journal references) arxiv_includeDOI For arxiv_format = \"arxiv\". If set to 1 displays and links any DOI associated with an article. 0 or 1 1 (show DOIs) arxiv_bg_color For arxiv_format = \"pretty\" , background color Any 6-digit hex color code 85BC8F (green) arxiv_border_color For arxiv_format = \"pretty\" , border color Any 6-digit hex color code 006400 (dark green) arxiv_entry_color For arxiv_format = \"pretty\" , background color of entries Any 6-digit hex color code FFFFFF (white) Setting the format/style with arxiv_format The arxiv_format variable sets the overall style of the output. This may be set to pretty (the default if not specified) or to arxiv . The pretty setting displays a compressed view of the feed in a 250 pixel ( 250px ) wide box, designed primarily for use in a sidebar. The background color for the heading bar and the border color of the box may be adjusted with the arxiv_bg_color and arxiv_border_color variables. The arxiv_entry_color variable refers to the background color of each article listed. Generally, this format looks best without the summaries displayed because otherwise the entries become very high (because of the limited width). The arxiv setting produces a display that looks similar to new listings displayed on arXiv.org, for instance, the list of new articles in Quantitative Biology . In this format, display of several fields may be turned on and off using the includeTitle , includeSummary , includeJournalRef and includeDOI variables. This display will fill the provided space. If you want to limit the width of the display, apply a width style to the div.arxivfeed element in your HTML page. A second myarticles example page shows the use of this format. How does the widget get the data? arXiv provides an Atom feed for your author identifier which includes information about all of the articles claimed under that author identifier. Those Atom documents are available by appending .atom to your author identifier, e.g. https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.atom . We have installed some server-side scripts that processes these feeds into a JSON feed which can then be processed using Javascript and Direct Script Attachment (DSA). This is one of the data formats used by Flickr and Yahoo and allows easy embedding of remote content into a dynamic page. You can take a look at the JSONP feed used by myarticles.js by going to https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.js . If you take a look at that datastream, you can see that it calls a function called jsonarXivFeed with the contents of feed in an associative array. Our JavaScript myarticles.js include provides the jsonarXivFeed function which processes the HTML into the displayed format.If you prefer to use unpadded JSON (without the jsonarXivFeed function call embedded in the feed), you can use the following URI instead: https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.json . If you have a unique way you'd like to process the data, you could write your own jsonarXivFeed function as well! There are several tutorials out there that demonstrate how to process the Flickr JSON feeds, you may find these helpful if you decide to undertake processing of the JSON feed yourself. If you come up with something neat, please let us know about it! Note that while we intend to persist the author identifier URIs (of the form https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid ) and the Atom feed URIs (of the form https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.atom ), the JSON feed URIs may change at some stage and we will update the JavaScript to cope with that.","title":"Myarticles"},{"location":"help/myarticles.html#using-the-myarticles-widget","text":"We have created a JavaScript widget that allows you to easily display your articles on your website, using the magic of JSON and Atom.

Those Atom documents are available by appending .atom to your author identifier, e.g. https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.atom . We have installed some server-side scripts that processes these feeds into a JSON feed which can then be processed using Javascript and Direct Script Attachment (DSA). This is one of the data formats used by Flickr and Yahoo and allows easy embedding of remote content into a dynamic page. You can take a look at the JSONP feed used by myarticles.js by going to https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.js . If you take a look at that datastream, you can see that it calls a function called jsonarXivFeed with the contents of feed in an associative array. Our JavaScript myarticles.js include provides the jsonarXivFeed function which processes the HTML into the displayed format.If you prefer to use unpadded JSON (without the jsonarXivFeed function call embedded in the feed), you can use the following URI instead: https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.json . If you have a unique way you'd like to process the data, you could write your own jsonarXivFeed function as well! There are several tutorials out there that demonstrate how to process the Flickr JSON feeds, you may find these helpful if you decide to undertake processing of the JSON feed yourself. If you come up with something neat, please let us know about it! Note that while we intend to persist the author identifier URIs (of the form https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid ) and the Atom feed URIs (of the form https://arxiv.org/a/yourauthorid.atom ), the JSON feed URIs may change at some stage and we will update the JavaScript to cope with that.","title":"How does the widget get the data?"},{"location":"help/myarticles_ex2.html","text":"Example using the myarticles widget with arxiv format This page illustrates use of the JavaScript myarticles widget and the \" arxiv \" display format which mimics the style of search results and listings on arXiv.

We say that a person is \"registered as an author\" if there is an authority record that links that person's account to a paper. Just as arXiv submitters are responsible for papers they submit, arXiv users are responsible for maintaining authority records for their papers. There are several reasons why a person might not be registered as an author: The user might not have a user account on arXiv: Some arXiv authors do not have an account for arXiv because other people have submitted all of the papers that they have authored. For instance, some professors have graduate students submit their own papers -- such a professor will not be automatically \"registered as an author\" for all of their papers. Prior to 6 July 2003, it was possible to submit papers to arXiv via e-mail without creating a user account. Thus, some people who are quite prolific do not have arXiv accounts and are not \"registered as an author\". If such a person creates a new account with the same e-mail address used for past submissions, we will automatically link their papers with their new account. The user might not have claimed ownership of the papers: People who submit papers to arXiv are automatically registered as paper owners who have the right to make changes to papers they submit. Currently, most people who are \"registered as author(s)\" are submitters, but co-authors can claim ownership of papers by using the paper password given to the submitters. Submitters should share the paper password with their co-authors so that we can correctly register all of the authors of a paper. You can claim ownership of a paper immediately if you have the paper password. If you cannot find the paper password, you can request that our administrators grant you ownership of a paper . Because it may take several days for administrators to get around to your request, this procedure should only be a last resort if you absolutely cannot get the paper password. The user might not have claimed authorship of the papers; Although we encourage authors to submit their own papers, some papers are submitted by persons other than the authors. For instance, at some research institutes, an administrative assistant makes all of the submissions for a single department. When you submit a paper we will ask if you are an author, and we will also ask you when you claim ownership of a paper. A user will not be \"registered as an author\" if they enter incorrect information at this point. We may have failed to have matched the user name: Prior to 17 Jan. 2003, we did not ask people if they were authors of the papers that they owned or submitted. During the upgrade, we had an automated process compare the names of paper owners and submitters to the authors of a paper. We made the user an author of a paper if the names matched, otherwise the user was registered as a non-author. Names can be ambiguous for many reasons, so no system of name matching can be perfect; although we have made some effort to tolerate alternate spelling and typographic errors and added heuristics for some common nicknames (\"Bob\" could really be \"Robert\"), our system has certainly made some mistakes.

The possible information fields are: Title: required Authors: required Abstract: required Comments: optional, but recommended Report-no: required (when supplied by author's institution) Category: depends on archive Journal-ref: reserved for publication info DOI: reserved publication DOI MSC-class: math archives only ACM-class: cs archives only Please read our FAQ page \" Submissions in languages other than English and multiple language submissions \" if your submission is in a language other than English or includes a version in a language other than English. Bad character(s) Our metadata fields only accept ASCII input. Unicode characters should be conveted to its $\\TeX$ equivalent (either through MathJax entry or for proper names use the appropriate accents ). A common problem experienced during submission, Bad character(s) in field... , is reporting UTF chracters being entered into a field that expects ASCII character entry. This is usually caused by the UTF characters being copied from your pdf viewer and then pasted as such during this step, rather than being entered as ASCII text. The most common culprits are the curved quotation marks (for example \u201c and \u201d instead of keyboard entry), long-hyphens (\u2014 or \u2013), and fi/ff copied as a single character. If you can't figure it out, type it out. Information Fields Title: required Do not use all uppercase letters. Do not use unicode characters. Some MathJax . Expand out $\\TeX$ macros that are mystifying, e.g. \"Nonlinear Sigma Models\" instead of \"\\nlsm\". Check your spelling. Certain $\\TeX$ accent commands may be used in this field. References to other articles in other archives should be given in the standard arXiv:arch-ive/YYMMNNN or arXiv:YYMM.NNNN(N) format so that our Web interface can turn the reference into a link to the article's abstract. Authors: required Policy Notes: It is a violation of our policies to misrepresent your identity or organizational affiliation. Claimed affiliation should be current in the conventional sense: e.g., physical presence, funding, e-mail address, etc. Misrepresentation of identity or affiliation, for any reason, is possible grounds for immediate and permanent suspension. It is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure that all authors consent to the article being submitted . It is the responsibility of the submitter to ensure that any author's information is correct prior to submission. Anonymous submissions are not accepted. Complete, and accurate author information is required. For named collaborations, it is acceptable to only use the collaboration name within the metadata, however a complete list of all authors and their affiliations must be contained in the full printed text. Usage: In order to automate indexing and searching, it is required that authors to be listed in a canonical format. Names should be given in the order: Firstname Lastname or Firstname Middlename Lastname (where Lastname is your family name). Do not include honorifics, such as \"Dr.\", \"Professor\", etc. Include the names of all authors instead of truncating the list with \" et al. \". This is necessary to support search and indexing. Multiple author names should be separated with a comma, E. L. Grossman, T. Zhou, E. Ben-Naim or with the word \"and\", Michael Dine, Yosef Nir and Yuri Shirman First names and middle names may be abbreviated with just an initial. Initials should be followed by a period and then a space. Do not use all uppercase letters for names. Do not enter a name that contains a comma or the word `and'. If you must include `Jr.' or similar suffix to a name then they must not be separated from the main name by a comma, enter simply Bill Gates Jr or Fred Bloggs IV . Names such as John von Neumann are entered exactly as illustrated. Do not include degree-granted suffixes such as \"MD\", \"PhD\", \"MSc\", \"BSc\", etc. Affiliations must be placed within parentheses. Do not enter full mailing address, as these are not needed in our metadata. If desired, at most, include a city and country (no zip codes, postal codes, or street addresses). If you have several authors from the same institution, you can use a footnote style for the affiliations. Here is an example (be sure to do it in the form presented here, including all parentheses, and using numbers and not letters): Authors: Author One (1), Author Two (1 and 2), Author Three (2) ((1) Institution One, (2) Institution Two) If the authors constitute a named collaboration, the collaboration name should be used in addition to all authors. Preferred formats are: Authors: ABCD Collaboration: Author One, Author Two, Author Three which is taken to mean that the article was written by the ABCD Collaboration which is comprised of Author One, Author Two and Author Three. Authors: Author One, Author Two, for the ABCD Collaboration which is taken to mean that the article was written by Author One and Author Two, on behalf of the ABCD Collaboration. Authors: Author One, Author Two (the ABCD Collaboration) which is taken to mean that the article was written by Author One and Author Two, who are members of the ABCD Collaboration. This format has the disadvantage that the collaboration name will not be linked to a search. Roles \u2014 such as editor , or appendix author \u2014 may not be indicated within the Authors field, rather roles should be indicated within the Comments field. Their names should be included in the Authors list. Such as: Authors: Author One, Author Two, Author Three Comments: Appendix by Author Two Certain $\\TeX$ accent commands may be used in this field. Abstract: required Abstracts are automatically processed into the mailings, so it is important to adhere to the formatting rules. Carriage returns will be stripped unless they are followed by leading white spaces. So if you want a new paragraph or a table of contents, be sure to indent the lines after the carriage return. When the abstract is formatted for email announcement, it will be wrapped to 80 characters. Do not include the word \"Abstract\". Some $\\TeX$ commands are supported via MathJax . As with the title, expand out opaque $\\TeX$ macros. Including $\\TeX$ formatting commands such as ~ \\, (backslash comma) and \\ (backslash space) makes it difficult for people to read. Please omit these TeX-isms. Also omit font commands such as \\em or \\it , as these will not be processed into the display. Additionally, $\\TeX$ formatting commands for names will not be processed, and unicode character entry is not supported. Do not start lines with whitespace (spaces, tabs, etc.) unless you are trying to prevent our automatic line wrapping. You might choose to use leading whitespace if for example your abstract is a table of contents. Avoid unnecessary blank lines. Keep it short \u2014 abstracts longer than 1920 characters will not be accepted; abridge your abstract if necessary. References to other articles in other archives should be given in the standard arXiv:arch-ive/YYMMNNN or arXiv:YYMM.NNNN(N) format so that our Web interface can turn the reference into a link to the article's abstract. Certain $\\TeX$ accent commands may be used in this field. Comments: Indicate number of pages and number of figures. If desired, include $\\TeX$ commands are supported via MathJax . Anonymous FTP and World Wide Web locations should be given in the standard Uniform Resource Locator (URL) format. We automatically convert these into an active link reading \"this ftp URL\" and an http URL into a link reading \"this http URL\" (try for a grammatically sensible substitution). The location of related files or information should be given here. Also, you should add a space to separate any periods or text following a URL from the URL itself, so that it is not interpreted as part of the URL. For example, the comment \"for associated mpeg file, see http://myhost.domain/file.mpg\" when accessed via the archive WWW interface views as \"for associated mpeg file, see \\<this URL>\" . References to other articles in other archives should be given in the standard arXiv:arch-ive/YYMMNNN or arXiv:YYMM.NNNN(N) format so that our Web interface can turn the reference into a link to the article's abstract. This is the proper field for \"to be published in\" or \"submitted to\" information, including inclusion in conference proceedings. Please note that such entries will be frozen into this version, and is not editable after announcement. This is the proper field for author roles, such as \"Appendix by\" or \"Editor\" information. If this is a replacement, indicate the nature of the replacement and the severity of the changes so readers will know why it was replaced. You may with to still include your original comments (e.g. number of pages), because the comments field is not cumulative. Do not put copyright statements in the comments, put them on the front page of the article. Even there, do not put any copyright or license statement that contradicts the license you grant arXiv on submission! For more information see our descriptions of available licenses . Certain $\\TeX$ accent commands may be used in this field. Report-no: required only when supplied by author's institution Enter your institution's locally assigned publication number. Do not put any other information in this field. Example: Report-no: EFI-94-11 . Category: Each arXiv article has a primary category and may also have one or more cross-lists to other categories. The categories control what mailings an article is announced in, and also provide a way to limit searches to subsets of arXiv. Some categories have just an archive name, such as hep-th or quant-ph . Others are broken into subject classes to give finer subject granularity: For the 'astro-ph' archive see list of astro-ph subject classes . For the 'cond-mat' archive see list of cond-mat subject classes . For the 'physics' archive see list of physics subject classes . For the 'math' archive see list of math subject classes . For the 'nlin' archive see list of nlin subject classes . For the 'cs' archive see list of cs subject classes . For the 'q-bio' archive see list of q-bio subject classes . For the 'q-fin' archive see list of q-fin subject classes . For the 'stat' archive see list of stat subject classes . For the 'eess' archive see list of eess subject classes . For the 'econ' archive see list of econ subject classes . Journal-ref: This field is only for a full bibliographic reference if the article has already appeared in a journal or a proceedings. Indicate the volume number, year, and page number (or page range). If your submission has not appeared yet, but you would still like to indicate where it will be published, use the Comments: field. Please note that the Comments field can only be updated by submitting a replacement . If there are multiple full bibliographic references associated with the paper, for example the original and an erratum, then separate them with a semicolon and a space, e.g. J.Hasty Results 1 (2008) 1-9; Erratum: J.Hasty Results 2 (2008) 1-2 In most cases, submissions are not yet published, and so Journal-ref information is not available. A facility is provided for you to add a journal reference to your previously submitted article at a later date. Do not put URLs into this field, as they will not be converted into links. DOI: This field is only for a DOI ( Digital Object Identifier ) that resolves (links) to another version of the article, in a journal for example. DOIs have the form 10.1016/S0550-3213(01)00405-9 If there are multiple DOIs associated with an article, separate them with a space. Do not include any other information in this field. In most cases, submissions are not yet published, and so DOI information will be added by the author at a later date. A facility is provided for adding a Journal-ref and DOI to a previously submitted article. MSC-class: For submissions to the math archive, this field is used to indicate the mathematical classification code according to the Mathematics Subject Classification . Here is an example MSC-class: 14J60 (Primary) 14F05, 14J26 (Secondary) Put the \"Primary\" and \"Secondary\" keywords in parentheses. If there is only a Primary classification, the \"Primary\" keyword is optional. Separate multiple classification keys with commas. ACM-class: For submissions to the cs archive, this field is used to indicate the classification code according to the ACM Computing Classification System (or see this overview ). Here is an example ACM-class: F.2.2; I.2.7 (Separate multiple classifications by a semicolon and a space.) Are you an author of this paper? Although arXiv encourages authors to submit their own articles, some articles may be submitted by third parties (co-workers, administrative assistants, overlay journals, etc.). Prior authorization is required for such submissions. If you are not the author this work you must contact arXiv administrators for permission. Submissions without prior authorization will be removed. The submitter of an article is automatically registered as an owner of the article, someone who has authorization to make changes to the article, such as replacing it or adding a cross-reference. Other people can become owners if they supply the paper password, or request ownership. See our authority records help page for more information. When someone is registered as an owner of an article, they have a chance to specify if they are also an author \u2014 to get all of their rights and privileges, authors of arXiv articles should take ownership of their articles and designate themselves as an author. Select yes if you are a listed author of the article you are submitting and no otherwise. Note on La$\\TeX$ accent commands: Two methods are supported for entering accented characters into arXiv. If your browser supports Unicode and you have the appropriate input method enabled on your computer, you can type them directly, and they will be converted into their $\\TeX$ syntax. You can enter accented characters using a subset of $\\TeX$ syntax. arXiv's subset of $\\TeX$ supports many of the ways accented characters can be written in $\\TeX$ , however, it only accepts characters from ISO Latin 1 (which is a subset of Unicode that can be represented as a single byte in UTF-8). Here are the La$\\TeX$ accents commands that can be used in the Title and Authors fields. \u00c4 \\\"A \u00e4 \\\"a \u00c1 \\'A \u00e1 \\'a \u0226 \\.A \u0227 \\.a \u0100 \\=A \u0101 \\=a \u00c2 \\^A \u00e2 \\^a \u00c0 \\`A \u00e0 \\`a \u0104 \\k{A} \u0105 \\k{a} \u00c5 \\r{A} \u00e5 \\r{a} \u0102 \\u{A} \u0103 \\u{a} \u01cd \\v{A} \u01ce \\v{a} \u00c3 \\~A \u00e3 \\~a \u0106 \\'C \u0107 \\'c \u010a \\.C \u010b \\.c \u0108 \\^C \u0109 \\^c \u00c7 \\c{C} \u00e7 \\c{c} \u010c \\v{C} \u010d \\v{c} \u010e \\v{D} \u010f \\v{d} \u00cb \\\"E \u00eb \\\"e \u00c9 \\'E \u00e9 \\'e \u0116 \\.E \u0117 \\.e \u0112 \\=E \u0113 \\=e \u00ca \\^E \u00ea \\^e \u00c8 \\`E \u00e8 \\`e \u0228 \\c{E} \u0229 \\c{e} \u0118 \\k{E} \u0119 \\k{e} \u0114 \\u{E} \u0115 \\u{e} \u011a \\v{E} \u011b \\v{e} \u0120 \\.G \u0121 \\.g \u011c \\^G \u011d \\^g \u0122 \\c{G} \u0123 \\c{g} \u011e \\u{G} \u011f \\u{g} \u01e6 \\v{G} \u01e7 \\v{g} \u0124 \\^H \u0125 \\^h \u021e \\v{H} \u021f \\v{h} \u00cf \\\"I \u00ef \\\"i \u00cd \\'I \u00ed \\'i \u0130 \\.I \u012a \\=I \u012b \\=i \u00ce \\^I \u00ee \\^i \u00cc \\`I \u00ec \\`i \u012e \\k{I} \u012f \\k{i} \u012c \\u{I} \u012d \\u{i} \u01cf \\v{I} \u01d0 \\v{i} \u0128 \\~I \u0129 \\~i \u0134 \\^J \u0135 \\^j \u0136 \\c{K} \u0137 \\c{k} \u01e8 \\v{K} \u01e9 \\v{k} \u0139 \\'L \u013a \\'l \u013b \\c{L} \u013c \\c{l} \u013d \\v{L} \u013e \\v{l} \u0143 \\'N \u0144 \\'n \u0145 \\c{N} \u0146 \\c{n} \u0147 \\v{N} \u0148 \\v{n} \u00d1 \\~N \u00f1 \\~n \u00d6 \\\"O \u00f6 \\\"o \u00d3 \\'O \u00f3 \\'o \u022e \\.O \u022f \\.o \u014c \\=O \u014d \\=o \u00d4 \\^O \u00f4 \\^o \u00d2 \\`O \u00f2 \\`o \u0150 \\H{O} \u0151 \\H{o} \u01ea \\k{O} \u01eb \\k{o} \u014e \\u{O} \u014f \\u{o} \u01d1 \\v{O} \u01d2 \\v{o} \u00d5 \\~O \u00f5 \\~o \u0154 \\'R \u0155 \\'r \u0156 \\c{R} \u0157 \\c{r} \u0158 \\v{R} \u0159 \\v{r} \u015a \\'S \u015b \\'s \u015c \\^S \u015d \\^s \u015e \\c{S} \u015f \\c{s} \u0160 \\v{S} \u0161 \\v{s} \u0162 \\c{T} \u0163 \\c{t} \u0164 \\v{T} \u0165 \\v{t} \u00dc \\\"U \u00fc \\\"u \u00da \\'U \u00fa \\'u \u016a \\=U \u016b \\=u \u00db \\^U \u00fb \\^u \u00d9 \\`U \u00f9 \\`u \u0170 \\H{U} \u0171 \\H{u} \u0172 \\k{U} \u0173 \\k{u} \u016e \\r{U} \u016f \\r{u} \u016c \\u{U} \u016d \\u{u} \u01d3 \\v{U} \u01d4 \\v{u} \u0168 \\~U \u0169 \\~u \u0174 \\^W \u0175 \\^w \u0178 \\\"Y \u00ff \\\"y \u00dd \\'Y \u00fd \\'y \u0232 \\=Y \u0233 \\=y \u0176 \\^Y \u0177 \\^y \u0179 \\'Z \u017a \\'z \u017b \\.Z \u017c \\.z \u017d \\v{Z} \u017e \\v{z} \u00e5 {\\aa} \u00c5 {\\AA} \u00e6 {\\ae} \u00c6 {\\AE} \u00d0 {\\DH} \u00f0 {\\dh} \u0111 {\\dj} \u0110 {\\DJ} \u00f0 {\\eth} \u00d0 {\\ETH} \u0131 {\\i} \u0142 {\\l} \u0141 {\\L} \u014b {\\ng} \u014a {\\NG} \u00d8 {\\O} \u00f8 {\\o} \u0153 {\\oe} \u0152 {\\OE} \u00df {\\ss} \u00fe {\\th} \u00de {\\TH} Examples The following are examples of how correctly completed metadata might appear in plain text email announcements: Example 1 Title: Recent Seminal Results in the Theory of Everything That I Have Been Working on Recently Authors: H.Z.

There are four sets of Type I fonts of interest to users of the archives and TeX users in general. These are the Bakoma, Blue-Sky, AMSFonts, and Paradissa font sets. Depending on your software, they may also display much better than traditional bitmap fonts (give them a try). The Bakoma fonts are a version of Computer Modern (the standard TeX font) which have been freely available for some time. The Blue-Sky fonts are a version of Computer Modern which were made freely available in early 1997. See the discussion on the AMS server for more information on the Blue-Sky font deal. The Paradissa fonts are extra fonts, including the AMS fonts and some Cyrillic fonts. The AMSFonts set includes the Euler, \"extra symbol\" and cyrillic fonts in selected sizes; these were produced by Blue Sky Research and made freely available in late 1997. See the the discussion on the AMS server and the AMS ftp site for the AMSFonts. What's the difference between Bakoma and Blue-Sky? With two font sets of different origin some compatibility questions arise, especially for documents with non-embedded fonts. First of all, the two font sets are basically interchangeable. Postscript or PDF documents with non-embedded fonts, which were created based on one font set, can be displayed using either of the two font sets. There is a minor problem with naming conventions for case sensitive operating systems. The Bakoma font names are all lowercase, while Blue-Sky font names are all uppercase. If your fontfiles don't match the font names in the Postscript or PDF file, you will have to translate the font names in the document (note that we offer Postscript and PDF files with a choice of naming convention ; for example Macintosh use fonts with upper case NAMES), or translate the case of your fontfiles or make symbolic links from uppercase to lowercase names. Blue-Sky fonts cover Knuth's 75 CM fonts (plus the extra LaTeX and SliTeX fonts) exactly , but no others, while the combination of Bakoma and Paradissa contains in addition the AMS fonts and some Cyrillic fonts. You will need these additional fonts from Bakoma and Paradissa if you want to read type 1 Postscript or PDF documents produced by arXiv. You will see incorrect symbols especially in math formulas without them. Which look better? One thing in favor of Bakoma fonts is that they are slightly darker (probably because of a different mode_def setting); this is probably an advantage since Computer Modern is a light font. Blue-Sky fonts are said to render better on high quality rasterizers like Adobe Type Manager (ATM), which make proper use of the \"hinting\" information in the fonts. One cannot see much of a difference between Blue-Sky and Bakoma fonts on a low quality font rasterizer.

Note that if your article or replacement has not yet been publicly announced you may select the Unsubmit ( ) icon next to the submission on your user page to return it to the incomplete status allowing modification and later resubmission via the Update ( ) icon. Considerations for replacing articles It is not possible to make changes without generating a new version. Indicate the nature of the changes. Same day edits do not generate a new date/version stamp, but may delay the replacement. Previous versions of your article will remain publicly available. Revisions after version 5 are not listed in the daily mailings. It is not possible to make changes without generating a new version Why? To allow authors to make changes to the comments and other metadata fields of publicly announced articles without generating a new version, and hence date stamp, would effectively mean that all changes would be backdated to the time the last version was submitted. This is open to abuse and thus not allowed. The exceptions to this rule are the addition of journal reference and DOI information . The journal reference field may contain only full publication information for the article; the DOI field may contain only a DOI. Indicate the nature of the changes Readers like to know why an article has been replaced. Often, changes are of a minor nature, but if the author does not indicate this then readers will generally assume the worst. Therefore, you should give some reason for the replacement. This should appear in the Comments: field of the new submission. Some typical reasons for replacing an article: Added references. Corrected typos. Revised argument in section 3, results unchanged. Example comments upon replacement: Comments: 32 pages harvmac; added references for section 5 Comments: 8 pages, LaTeX; typos corrected, references added Remember to merge your original comments with the new ones. If you do not, then the old comments will be lost. For instance, in the examples above, the TeX related comments and page counts were copied from the previous versions of the comments, since they are still valid and useful. Same day edits do not generate a new version stamp. Edits made during the same day before 14:00 US Eastern Time (EDT/EST) Monday to Friday will not generate a new version stamp in the archives and will not delay announcement.

These submissions can be made smaller by making the figures more efficient. We do not accept submissions with omitted figures, see policy information below. If you have trouble submitting a very long paper, such as a long review article with many small figures, or a thesis, AND you are sure that you have efficient figures, then contact the arXiv administrators to ask for an exception (be sure to quote the automatic rejection identifier and to explain the large size). Please think about the time it will take people to download your papers. arXiv is a resource used throughout the world and many users do not have the fast reliable network connections, fast computers, and printers with large memory that are common in large universities. Making Submissions Smaller Use of the appropriate tools and image formats for figures is the key to preparing an efficient submission that will be convenient for people to download. Most submissions to arXiv are fine, but some submissions include files in inefficient and unnecessarily large formats. Most oversized figures can easily be shrunk by appropriate choice of format or resolution. Photographic images should usually use JPEG encoding. Diagrams and line drawings should preferably use PDF, PNG, GIF or PostScript. For a discussion on shrinking figures, see our help on bitmapping . It is possible that you will receive a notification message asking you to take a few simple steps to convert your biggest files into more suitable formats before resubmitting. Additional Policy Information If you include reduced size figures with your submission you are free to include larger figures as ancillary files or provide links to larger alternative versions of figures stored at your website. We do not accept submissions with omitted figures. Quickly Reducing File Size It is possible to quickly reduce the overall file size of your submission by running a simple bash shell command: for i in *ps; do ps2pdf -DEPSCrop $i; done; This command will convert all the files matching filenames ending with ps (which will cover both .eps as well as .ps figures).

We only accept submissions from registered authors . If you are a new user or are submitting to a new category, you may be required to find endorsements . All submissions are subject to a moderation process that verifies material is appropriate and topical. Material that contains offensive language, non-scientific content, or is plagiarized may be removed. Authors must grant arXiv.org a non-exclusive and irrevocable license to distribute or certify that the work is available under another license that conveys these rights. Authors must agree to the submission terms and agreement and Instructions for submission . Authors are expected to self-submit. Submissions by a third party are accepted under limited conditions. See instructions for third-party submissions and index submissions for conference proceedings. New submissions received by 14:00 (Eastern Daylight/Standard Time Zone) are generally made available at 20:00 (Eastern) but are subject to delays in the moderation process (see the schedule for details .) Submission Preparation Formats for text submission Formats for figures File names and case sensitivity Inclusion of data sets and ancillary files (data, programs, etc.) Title and abstract preparation Verify and correct your submission Edit or replace your submission To submit an article, use the submit form or select \"START NEW SUBMISSION\" from your user page . Formats for text of submission Accepted submission formats (in order of preference): (La)TeX, AMS(La)TeX, PDFLaTeX PDF HTML with JPEG/PNG/GIF images Our goal is to store articles in formats that are highly portable and stable over time. Currently, the best choice is TeX/LaTeX. We do not accept dvi, PS, or PDF created from TeX/LaTeX source , and we do not accept scanned documents, regardless of format. Formats for figures Accepted figure formats: PostScript (PS, EPS) \u2014 requires LaTeX processing JPEG, GIF, PNG or PDF figures \u2014 requires PDFLaTeX processing We do not accept submissions with omitted figures, even if you provide links to view figures externally. If you submit figures with your (La)TeX source, use standard macro packages (e.g., the graphics and graphicx packages) to have figures appear in the document. arXiv administration cannot provide help with TeX-related issues. File names and case sensitivity arXiv will accept only the following characters in file names: a-z A-Z 0-9 _ + - . , = File names that contain other characters (e.g., spaces, question marks, asterisks) will be rejected. These restrictions ensure maximum portability of the stored files and minimize archival risk. File names and extensions are also case sensitive on our system. The file names Figure1.PDF and figure1.pdf are not the same. Whether your local system is case sensitive (e.g., Unix) or not (e.g., Windows) you must ensure that internal file references, such as LaTeX figure inclusion commands, match case exactly. Inclusion of ancillary files There are limited facilities for including data sets and ancillary files (data, programs, etc.) that are associated with articles submitted to arXiv. See separate instructions about including data sets and ancillary files. Title and abstract preparation See separate instructions for preparing the title and abstract for inclusion in metadata. This information is used on the abstract pages, in announcements, in RSS feeds, and to support searching. Verify and correct your submission Before you make the final \"Submit Article\" step in the submission process, be sure to carefully check the title and abstract (metadata) and the processed files, and correct any errors. Contact arXiv administrators for help. If you discover an error after submission but before public announcement, select the \"Unsubmit\" ( ) icon next to the submission on your user page . This will return it to incomplete status and allow you to modify your files and resubmit. Unsubmitting an article takes the article out of the processing queue, and announcement will be scheduled based on the later resubmission time. See the schedule of availability . Edit or replace your submission Edits before a submission is publicly announced will not generate additional versions. The date stamp associated with the submission will be the time that the final \"Submit Article\" step is completed. Edits and final submission before 14:00 US Eastern Time (EDT/EST) Monday through Friday will not delay announcement. You may wish to check current local time . We encourage authors to update and to make corrections to their articles. DO NOT make a new submission for a corrected article or for an erratum. Instead, replace the original submission. Availability of submissions and announcement order Submissions to arXiv are typically made public Sunday through Thursday, with no announcements Friday or Saturday. Check the current time at the arXiv main site, with the amount of time remaining before the deadline. Submissions are made public as part of the scheduled announcement process. This includes new submissions as well as replacements , withdrawal notices , cross listings and journal reference . Journal reference submissions do not appear in the mailings, but are still processed at that time.

Conference proceedings may be made as a single submission (which is handled in the normal way), or as a set of individual papers with an index submission. Note individual papers within a proceedings must still conform to arXiv content polices and are moderated, as usual. Ideally, an index or overlay should provide information beyond what would be available from a keyword search on the Report-no metadata field. In general, we prefer arrangements where the respective authors submit the individual papers. We provide two ways of partially automating the process of creating HTML index submissions which are best suited to two different scenarios: Index submitted after the individual papers . We have support for the automatic extraction of metadata from the individual submissions using special processing instructions from within an HTML index submission which lists the arXiv identifiers of the individual papers. A good example is arXiv:1205.2597 . Index submitted before the individual papers . We have support for automatic linking to a search on the report number field. Conference organizers must instruct the submitters of individual papers to include a unique report number in the Report-no: field of their submission. The HTML index submission includes special processing instructions which create links to the report number search. An example using this approach is arXiv:1108.3558 . Please note that conference announcements, or indexes without the articles indicated, are not permitted. We accept index submissions before the submission of individual papers with the understanding that the majority of papers at the conference will be submitted. If in doubt contact arXiv administrators . Note that it is not appropriate to submit an overlay or index of content not in arXiv. Index submission after individual papers The simplest way to make a proceedings or index entry is to create an HTML submission using special LIST:arXiv:YYMM.NNNN or LIST:arch-ive/YYMMNNN (only for old identifiers like hep-lat/9801024), directives which are expanded by arXiv's HTML interpreter to the full title/author listings in the usual local format (with the author names linked to the search; using whatever cookies the users' browsers send to determine the output format; and all paper links local to the same site the index is retrieved from).

Unfortunately, many people are under the illusion that submitting PostScript is ideal because it can be printed directly or viewed on the screen. Authors who write in TeX should never submit PostScript, except for figure attachments (see discussion of benefits of TeX source ). If you use an old version of a word processor such as MS Word then PostScript may be a good option. However, PDF is usually better if your word processor supports it. If you use bitmapped fonts or you have some other resolution dependence, produce the PostScript file at 300 dpi for maximum portability. You must submit any figures that go along with your paper. For PostScript submissions it is best to produce a single PostScript file that includes all figures. However, you may also submit figures in separate PostScript (ps, eps) files.

Level 2 PostScript can contain special commands which only work on newer printers. Many people have Level 1 PostScript printers and cannot print Level 2 documents. If you are allowed to set the resolution, make sure you produce the PostScript at 300 dpi since not everyone has higher resolution printers (and the output quality can be very poor when one tries to print high resolution PostScript to a lower resolution printer).

Preface The arXiv SWORD Deposit API allows programmatic submission of material for ingestion into the arXiv database hosted at arXiv.org . SWORD defines a web service for repository deposit based on the Atom Publishing Protocol ( APP ), RFC5023 . The implementation of SWORD/APP at arXiv closely follows the SWORD APP Profile version 1.3 (SWORD/APP) and is intended to be interoperable with all SWORD client implementations to the extent possible. This manual provides detailed documentation of SWORD transactions with arXiv, mandatory extension elements, error conditions, and usage examples. Please review the Terms of Use for arXiv APIs before using the SWORD Deposit API. Sample code in Perl is presented to demonstrate individual steps. 2. Overview and Control Flow The SWORD/APP deposit operation and subsequent ingestion into the arXiv system are separate processes, with the latter being initiated and proceeding asynchronously after the SWORD/APP communication is completed. In order to keep client side implementation simple, arXiv does not require or support complex packaging formats. A SWORD/APP deposit to arXiv consists of two steps. one or more media deposits, containing the main body of the material along with any accompanying ancillary material, are made. Deposit of a zip file, which conveniently bundles all components, is also possible. All accepted deposits are assigned unique identifiers and are held in the user\u2019s workspace. The atom entry response to a deposit contains a reference link to the corresponding media entry. upon successful deposit of all components of a contribution, an atom entry containing the required arXiv metadata and references to the previously made media entries is deposited. This entry triggers assembly of the referenced media entries and hands off the entire package to the arXiv ingest system. The atom entry response from arXiv contains a link of \u201crel=alternate\u201d, which allows to track the progression of the submission in the arXiv system. At this point the SWORD/APP communication is complete. Problems or errors with a deposit are signified by a HTTP 4xx status code and accompanied by a <sword:error> response from arXiv providing further information on the particular error. Subsequent feedback and alerts from the arXiv ingest system, e.g. processing problems, moderation issues, reclassification, assigned arXiv identifier and paper password etc. will be send by email to the primary contact author specified in the metadata and the registered user, whose credentials were used for the deposit. 3. Before Using SWORD at arXiv This interface is primarily intended for use by conference organizers, proceedings and journal editors, etc. for programmatic bulk upload of pre-vetted material to arXiv for long term archival and dissemination. It is assumed that this is done with the (implied or explicit) approval of the authors of individual contributions or on their behalf. Individual authors may prefer arXiv\u2019s interactive web upload for personal use, because it provides better feedback mechanisms, but in principle the deposit API can be used for one-at-a-time deposit to arXiv by individual authors, too. We envision integration of the deposit process into authoring tools for efficient upload from the desktop. 3.1. Registration In accordance with general arXiv submission policy, SWORD/APP deposits require a valid author registration with arXiv. Help on how to obtain a registration is available at registerhelp . In addition, prospective users of the deposit API must request authorization to do so via email to arXiv administrators ( contact ), at least during the initial beta phase of the SWORD interface. 3.2. Licensing arXiv requires assurance of sufficient rights by the author or submitter to allow distribution of the deposited material in perpetuity. In order to submit an article to arXiv, the submitter must grant arXiv.org a non-exclusive and irrevocable license to distribute the article, and certify that they have the right to grant this license certify that the work is available under either the Creative Commons Attribution license, or the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-ShareAlike license, and that they have the right to grant this license, or certify that the work is in the public domain (we will store this information by associating the Create Commons Public Domain Declaration with the submission) Since license negotiation is outside of the SWORD protocol, arXiv requires that users register a default license for SWORD deposits at https://arxiv.org/sword-license before using the SWORD API. If no license for a depositor is on file with arXiv, the API responds with a HTTP 412 Precondition Failed status code and a sword:error entry pointing to the license selection page. 3.3. arXiv Metadata and Classification It is essential that users are familiar with the arXiv classification system and general metadata requirements in order to correctly and usefully describe their submission in terms of arXiv metadata or to determine a good mapping of their metadata format to arXiv\u2019s metadata format. This is best accomplished by browsing (the relevant subcategories of) arXiv.org . 3.4. SSL/TLS and HTTP Basic Authentication The entire SWORD/APP interaction is via SSL/TLS (i.e. https:// ), and requires authentication via HTTP Basic Authentication in the realm \"SWORD at arXiv\" . This provides for secure transactions and also protects the interface from unwanted access. Note however that authenticity does not imply integrity. To ensure the latter material deposited via SWORD/APP should use the SWORD HTTP extension header Content-MD5, which provides for verification of the MD5 checksum of the payload. The inlined examples below are presented with the SSL/TLS and authentication layers (mostly) peeled away for brevity. arXiv uses a certificate issued and signed by InCommon Server CA. The fingerprint of arXiv\u2019s server certificate is SHA1 Fingerprint=D4:FA:60:66:1D:17:94:B3:D2:EB:1A:A6:8A:DB:0E:34:48:EF:4B:1E Notes : until 11/16/2011 arXiv used a GeoTrust certificate with SHA1 Fingerprint=F9:91:88:20:E0:82:EC:89:3A:90:29:C6:2B:F3:76:39:81:1D:76:26 until 12/15/2010 arXiv used its own private certificate authority (CA) which was used to sign the server certificate. The fingerprint of arXiv\u2019s server certificate was SHA1 Fingerprint=7F:3B:78:D1:5C:CD:4F:C0:35:AC:FB:D9:F7:02:3B:C0:B5:B0:95:C5 A copy of the CA certificate and fingerprint can be provided on request to contact . 4. The SWORD/APP Deposit Process The BaseURL for all SWORD/APP interaction with arXiv is https://arxiv.org/sword-app/ Typically the first step in a SWORD/APP interaction is service exploration via retrieval of the servicedocument describing the workspaces, collections, and capabilities of the SWORD/APP endpoint. 4.1. The Servicedocument arXiv\u2019s servicedocument is specific to the user initiating a deposit\u2009\u2014\u2009or via the X-On-Behalf-Of HTTP header \u2009\u2014\u2009the author in whose name a deposit is being made. The main reason for customization is that the enumeration of available collections and primary categories depends on the author\u2019s or submitter\u2019s privileges. The servicedocument can be retrieved via a regular GET request: GET https://arxiv.org/sword-app/servicedocument HTTP/1.1 Host: arxiv.org or with mediated user GET https://arxiv.org/sword-app/servicedocument HTTP/1.1 Host: arxiv.org X-On-Behalf-Of: <some-registered-user> Although it is intended for purely programmatic access, the servicedocument can be retrieved with a regular web browser. With proper customization of helper rules for mime type \"application/atomsvc+xml\" , the servicedocument can be displayed inline in a web browser as regular XML. The response to a successful request for the servicedocument is similar to HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Fri, 25 Apr 2008 22:15:08 GMT Content-Type: application/atomsvc+xml Expires: Sat, 26 Apr 2008 22:15:08 GMT and the general structure of the returned servicedocument is <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <service xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2007/app\" xmlns:atom=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:sword=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/\" xmlns:dcterms=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom/\"> <sword:version>1.3</sword:version> <sword:maxUploadSize>10000</sword:maxUploadSize> <sword:verbose>true</sword:verbose> <sword:noOp>true</sword:noOp> <workspace> <atom:title>arXiv</atom:title> <collection href=\"https://arxiv.org/sword-app/...-collection\"> ... </collection> ... </workspace> </service> The servicedocument specifies the capabilities of arXiv\u2019s SWORD implementation, e.g. the maximal allowed size of uploads in kB ( <sword:maxUploadSize> ), and enumerates the collections for which the (mediated) user has submission privileges along with collection specific information, like accepted media-types ( <accept> ), accepted packaging format ( <acceptPackaging> ), collection policy ( <collectionPolicy> ), etc. declarations. See RFC5023 for specification and the SWORD specific extensions described in SWORD APP Profile version 1.3 . 4.1.1. Collections and arXiv Classification Each collection comes with its own arXiv specific list of \u201c primary categories \u201d. These are regular atom category elements. However to distinguish them from categories denoting secondary classification, they are specified via the arXiv extension element <primary_category xmlns=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom/\"> . There is also a long list of (optional) secondary categories, which are regular atom category elements. Specifying appropriate secondary classification gives submissions visibility in the relevant sub-communities of arXiv. A special feature of secondary categories for the Computer Science and Mathematics collections is that they include the ACM and MSC subject classifications respectively. Note: The available terms for ACM (D.2, F.1.1, etc.) and MSC (43A15, 62M10, etc.) classifications are not spelled out in the servicedocument. Authors have to determine the appropriate classification from publicly available listings and complete the term attribute accordingly. The servicedocument enumerates the available choices for each collection. As described below (see Initiate Ingestion ), the atom entry containing the metadata describing and completing a deposit to arXiv must have exactly one valid primary_category and can have zero or more secondary categories selected from those listed in the servicedocument. For example, the servicedocument lists the following choice of primary_categories for the Statistics collection : <collection href=\"https://arxiv.org/sword-app/stat-collection\"> <atom:title>The Statistics archive</atom:title> .... <arxiv:primary_categories fixed=\"yes\"> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.AP\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Applications\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.CO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Computation\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.ML\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Machine Learning\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.ME\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Methodology\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.TH\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Theory\"/> </arxiv:primary_categories> ... </collection> and a deposit to /sword-app/stat-collection must contain exactly one of these. While arXiv categories are typically stable for months or years, sometimes existing categories are modified or re-assigned, and new categories are added. It is therefore recommended to periodically re-check the servicedocument for additions or modifications (note that arXiv returns a HTTP Expires header of 1 day). The Perl script servicedoc.pl provides a sample implementation of arXiv servicedocument retrieval. With option \u201c --verbose \u201d it uses the XML::Atom::Service module from CPAN to demonstrate parsing of the returned XML. Unless provided on the command-line, user-name and password will be prompted for. 4.2. Media Deposit A media deposit (in the parlance of APP) is any deposit of material of one of the accepted media types to an arXiv collection via SWORD/APP. The submission privileges of the (mediated) user determine what collection(s) are permissible for a deposit. Note : In particular for typical TeX submissions it is recommended to create a zip file of the TeX source files, macros, figures, etc and to deposit that as a single package. Other media deposits can be docx , pdf , (e)ps , jpg , png , etc., and it may be useful to individually deposit large figures or other material of substantial file size, instead of attempting to upload everything at once. A deposit is performed via POST to the appropriate collection URL selected from the servicedocument, e.g. a deposit of a jpg image to the Computer Science collection looks like POST https://arxiv.org/sword-app/cs-collection Host: arxiv.org User-Agent: arXiv SWORD demo 1.1 Content-Type: image/jpeg Authorization: Basic .......................= data stream .... The payload is the material to be deposited. Optionally there can be a X-On-Behalf-Of: HTTP header to specify the author of the material as opposed to the user making the deposit, along with other optional SWORD extensions headers, and in particular a md5 checksum in the Content-MD5: header to ensure integrity of the transferred data: POST https://arxiv.org/sword-app/cs-collection Host: arxiv.org User-Agent: arXiv SWORD demo 1.1 Content-Type: image/jpeg Content-MD5: p1T0tIZT/JyAgwevT+zHKw== Authorization: Basic .......................= data stream ... The response to a successful deposit is status 201 Created along with a Location header, which contains a URL pointing to the created media link entry (identifier replaced with ellipsis) HTTP/1.1 201 Created Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2008 18:35:46 GMT Location: https://arxiv.org/sword-app/getid/app/........ Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry The response content is the associated media link entry created in the author\u2019s workspace at arXiv. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:sword=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/\"> <author> <name>A.

It doesn\u2019t have the full classification, because it is not yet known which subject category of the Computer Science collection the submission will go to. Failure to verify the MD5 checksum will result in status 412 Precondition Failed and a SWORD <sword:error> entry with attribute href=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/error/ErrorChecksumMismatch\" : HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition Failed Date: Tue, 29 Apr 2008 19:38:05 GMT Content-Type: application/xml and a corresponding atom entry with human readable error message ?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <sword:error xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:sword=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/\" xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom/\" href=\"http://purl.org/net/sword/error/ErrorChecksumMismatch\"> <author> <name>SWORD@arXiv</name> </author> <title>ERROR</title> <id>info:arxiv/79652319-FB86-3C12-AC51-46D44EF5A410</id> <updated>2008-04-29T19:38:05Z</updated> <source> <generator uri=\"http://arxiv.org/sword-app/\" version=\"0.9\">SWORD@arXiv.org</generator> </source> <sword:treatment>processing failed</sword:treatment> <sword:userAgent>arXiv SWORD demo 1.1</sword:userAgent> <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/help\" type=\"text/html\"/> <arxiv:errorcode>1048576</arxiv:errorcode> <summary>MD5 sum did not match</summary> </sword:error> An accepted media deposit is held in the user\u2019s workspace until further processing. arXiv returns the media link entry created for the deposited media. The entry has a link of rel=\u201cedit-media , which will be used to reference the deposited material. The Perl script media-deposit.pl demonstrates how individual files can be deposited in the user\u2019s SWORD/APP workspace at arXiv. The simplest invocation is $ ./media-deposit.pl --filename=<...> --collection=<...> The response is parsed and presented like this (filename and identifiers replaced with ellipsis) Deposit of '..........' to arXiv was successful. The returned HTTP status and Location: Status: 201 Created Location: https://arxiv.org/sword-app/getid/app/........ -------------------------------------------------------------- The deposited media resource should be referenced as: https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/........ See $ perldoc media-deposit.pl for more options. It is important to take note of the edit-media link or the identifier assigned to the media deposit, in order to reference the deposited material in the next step. 4.3. Metadata and Ingestion Initiation Once all components of a submission are deposited, the final step is to provide the metadata describing the content of the submission and referencing the previously deposited media entries. This is done by POST-ing a specially crafted atom entry with mime-type application/atom+xml;type=entry to the same collection URI as the previously posted media entries. The \u201cwrapper\u201d entry is an atom entry , as defined by the Atom Syndication Format ( RFC 4287 ), with certain mandatory and some optional extension elements. Most arXiv metadata elements have a direct mapping to standard atom entry elements, and these are used where possible. However arXiv metadata is richer than what the standard atom entry provides for. A detailed description of all arXiv entry elements can be found in the arXiv Atom API documentation. Note : A good way to understand the mapping of metadata between arXiv and atom is to look at examples. Compare the rendering of metadata for an arXiv paper as atom feed (XML) with the rendering as web page (XHTML) Apart from other requirements for an atom entry (id, updated, etc), the wrapper for a arXiv submission must contain Mandatory Elements <title> <author> <contributor> * <summary> <arxiv:primary_category \u2026> <link rel=related \u2026> * and may contain additional metadata, where available Optional Elements <category> * <arxiv:comment> <arxiv:journal_ref> * <arxiv:doi> <arxiv:report_no> * <arxiv:affiliation> * (* indicates repeatable elements) The <author> element is used for the authenticated user, i.e. the person who initiates the submission. The repeatable <contributor> element is used to specify the individual authors of the material being deposited to arXiv. At least one /contributor/email node must be present in order to inform arXiv of the email address of the primary contact author. If multiple /contributor/email nodes are found, the first will be used. Optionally the primary contact author\u2019s (name and) email address can also be specified in the X-On-Behalf-Of HTTP header extension, e.g.: X-On-Behalf-Of: \"A. Scientist\" <ascientist@institution.edu> This is useful to disambiguate when multiple /contributor/email nodes are present. The <arxiv:primary_category> must be selected from the list of available choices for the collection, as given in the servicedocument. The link(s) of relation \u201c related \u201d must refer to the previously deposited material. Title and summary have their obvious meaning. The summary must be at least 20 characters long. The title will be checked against other recently arXiv-ed papers to avoid inadvertent double submissions. Category element(s) can be used to provide secondary classification(s), selected from those listed in the servicedocument. Please refer to the arXiv submission help for explanation of the other optional fields. The \u201cwrapper\u201d is POST-ed to the same collection URI as the previously deposited media. For example, a submission of a single PDF file to the physics collection POST https://arxiv.org/sword-app/physics-collection HTTP/1.1 Host: arxiv.org User-Agent: arXiv SWORD demo 1.1 Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry Authorization: Basic .......................= <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <title>A strangely unique title</title> <id>A8A725C2-10E7-11DD-A667-67C33A33DA4A</id> <updated>2008-04-23T03:45:04Z</updated> <author> <name>B.

Note : The arXiv identifier and paper password will also be send by email to the primary contact author. 5. Verification and Tracking Once the SWORD/APP transaction is completed, the submission is automatically queued for ingestion into the arXiv system. Acceptance of the wrapper does not imply that ingestion will be successful. Among other things there could be problems with moderator approval, classification, format conversion (e.g. TeX \u2192 PS, .docx \u2192 PDF, etc.), duplication detection, etc.. The eventual success or failure of ingestion will be communicated by email to the primary contact author (and optionally to the submitter/authenticated user). When applicable the email contains the permanent arXiv identifier and paper password. It is important that the author/submitter closely inspect the representation of the submission at arXiv and take corrective action where necessary, see checking . The status of a SWORD deposit may be tracked using the tracking URI returned in the Atom <link> element with rel=\"alternate\" , for example: <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/resolve/app/10030146\"/> The response to GET <http://arxiv.org/resolve/app/10030146> will be a short XML report on the status of this SWORD submission in the arXiv workflow. An example initial response is: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <deposit> <tracking_id>http://arxiv.org/resolve/app/10030146</tracking_id> <status>submitted</status> </deposit> An example after publication is: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <deposit> <tracking_id>http://arxiv.org/resolve/app/10030146</tracking_id> <status>published</status> <arxiv_id>1003.9876</arxiv_id> </deposit> The root element will always be <deposit> and will always contain a <status> element which contains one of the following: Status Values submitted - The SWORD submission is in the normal arXiv workflow and is queued to be announced according to the usual arXiv announcement schedule. published - The SWORD submission has been accepted and published by arXiv. The response will also include the final arXiv identifier in the <arxiv_id> element. on hold - The SWORD submission is in arXiv\u2019s workflow but was identified by arXiv administrators or moderators as needing further attention. incomplete - This status is not expected to be used for SWORD submissions. The submission is in process but not yet submitted and queued. unknown - The tracking URI is not know. More information may be given in an <error> element. 6. Replacement arXiv\u2019ed papers can be updated or replaced. The rules for a replacement via the web interface also apply to a replacement using SWORD. In particular a new version number will be assigned unless it is a same day replacement , and all previously published versions remain accessible. For a replacement of a previously created resource via SWORD/APP arXiv uses the \u201cEditing Resources with PUT \u201d functionality as outlined in the SWORD specification and specifically RFC5023 section 9.3 applied to the metadata wrapper of the original deposit. A replacement via SWORD can only be made by a registered paper owner or the author of the original SWORD deposit when authenticated with the same credentials. There are no per paper passwords for replacements via SWORD. Most of the mechanics of the replacement are the same as those of a new SWORD deposit. Steps for a replacement First all the media resources should be individually posted or deposited packed together into a zip file. Previously deposited media resources in the workspace of the authenticated user can be referenced via their edit-media links, e.g. <link rel=\"edit-media\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/........\"/> if they have not expired yet. arXiv retains individual media deposits via SWORD for at least 30 days. Then a metadata wrapper is PUT to the link with rel=\"edit\u201d which was part of the atom entry response to the original wrapper deposit, e.g. <link rel=\"edit\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/09011841.atom\"/> The metadata wrapper is constructed in similar fashion as for a new submission, however it must be deposited using PUT to the link with rel=\u201cedit\u201d that was returned upon original submission. PUT https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/09031234.atom HTTP/1.1 Host: arxiv.org User-Agent: arXiv SWORD demo 1.1 Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry Authorization: Basic .......................= To modify an existing wrapper, authors can first issue a GET request to the edit link of that wrapper, modify the returned atom entry and then deposit it via a PUT request to the same edit link. The response to a successful PUT is status 202 Accepted HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted Date: Sat, 21 Mar 2009 00:06:27 GMT Location: https://arxiv.org/sword-app/getid/app/........ Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry along with an atom entry in the response content confirming acceptance. Notes : To replace a paper using the permanent arXiv identifier ( <id> ), submit the metadata wrapper via PUT to https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/<id> e.g. for arXiv:0708.0123 use PUT to https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/0708.0123 and for arXiv:cond-mat/9904123 use PUT to https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/cond-mat/9904123 arXiv does not permit the classification of an article to be changed during a replacement operation. The arxiv:primary_category element must match the existing primary category. The replacment metadata may contain either no category elements, or a set of category elements that matches the existing categories. The authenticated user must > be the paper owner. Ownership can be claimed with the paper password . 7. Error Conditions and Error Codes Error handling is outlined in Part A.5 of the SWORD specification , where a SWORD extension element to AtomPub called sword:error is introduced. This allows for a much more informative error message in addition to the regular HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes which are part of the base protocol. arXiv uses this mechanism to provide informative error messages in the body of the error response along with a corresponding numeric error code and a href attribute. The error response content is a regular atom entry with a root element of sword:error , a href attribute containing a URI which identifies the error, a human readable error presented in the summary element and the numeric error code in the arxiv:errorcode extension element. The HTTP status for all errors not otherwise defined in the SWORD spec is 400 Bad Request . The numerical error codes are powers of 2 (for convenient bitmasking, multiple error indication, etc). The list of all currently defined arxiv:errorcodes is: 2\\^n error message 0 method not supported 1 unrecognized POST request 2 unrecognized GET request 3 GET not supported for this request. Use POST instead 4 invalid collection 5 momentary overload. Try again in a few seconds 6 service temporarily unavailable 7 No author name 8 No contact email 9 invalid contact email 10 No primary category specified 11 primary category invalid 12 more than one primary category specified 13 category element(s) invalid 14 No summary or summary too short.

A Complete Example As a practical example, we demonstrate what the submission of an existing article, arXiv:hep-th/0605021 via SWORD/APP would look like. The article consists of 3 individual files, a TeX source file and 2 figure files. These are packaged in a zip file (submission.zip), which is then deposited to the physics collection of the arXiv SWORD endpoint. To ensure data integrity, the deposit is accompanied by the optional MD5 checksum of the payload $ ./media-deposit.pl --collection=physics --filename=submission.zip --verbose --md5 Enter username for \"SWORD@arXiv\": demouser Password for demouser: The response status and reference link are displayed Deposit of 'submission.zip' to arXiv was successful.

Questions, Concerns, Suggestions Please contact arXiv with any questions or suggestions. The SWORD interface is currently in beta and there is certainly room for improvements. Note that we purposely did not use a complex object format, to keep the entry threshold low. 10. API Updates (last update: 2013-01-11) 2013-01-11 : In 2012-12 the https://arxiv.org/sword-app/nlin-collection was removed and all nlin (Nonlinear Sciences) categories (e.g. http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/nlin.AO ) were reorganized within the https://arxiv.org/sword-app/physics-collection collection. This change is reflected in the Servicedocument . This corresponds with moving the nlin archive into the physics group in the arXiv classification scheme and user-interface.","title":"Submit sword"},{"location":"help/submit_sword.html#arxivorg-swordapp-deposit-api-users-manual","text":"Table of Contents Preface Overview Preconditions Registration Licensing arXiv Metadata and Classification SSL/TLS and HTTP Basic Authentication The SWORD/APP Deposit Process The Servicedocument Collections and arXiv Classification Media Deposit Metadata and Ingestion Initiation Verification and Tracking Replacement Error Conditions and Error Codes A Complete Example Questions, Concerns, Suggestions API Updates","title":"arXiv.org SWORD/APP Deposit API User's Manual"},{"location":"help/submit_sword.html#1-preface","text":"The arXiv SWORD Deposit API allows programmatic submission of material for ingestion into the arXiv database hosted at arXiv.org .

Preface"},{"location":"help/submit_sword.html#2-overview-and-control-flow","text":"The SWORD/APP deposit operation and subsequent ingestion into the arXiv system are separate processes, with the latter being initiated and proceeding asynchronously after the SWORD/APP communication is completed. In order to keep client side implementation simple, arXiv does not require or support complex packaging formats. A SWORD/APP deposit to arXiv consists of two steps. one or more media deposits, containing the main body of the material along with any accompanying ancillary material, are made. Deposit of a zip file, which conveniently bundles all components, is also possible. All accepted deposits are assigned unique identifiers and are held in the user\u2019s workspace. The atom entry response to a deposit contains a reference link to the corresponding media entry. upon successful deposit of all components of a contribution, an atom entry containing the required arXiv metadata and references to the previously made media entries is deposited. This entry triggers assembly of the referenced media entries and hands off the entire package to the arXiv ingest system. The atom entry response from arXiv contains a link of \u201crel=alternate\u201d, which allows to track the progression of the submission in the arXiv system. At this point the SWORD/APP communication is complete. Problems or errors with a deposit are signified by a HTTP 4xx status code and accompanied by a <sword:error> response from arXiv providing further information on the particular error. Subsequent feedback and alerts from the arXiv ingest system, e.g. processing problems, moderation issues, reclassification, assigned arXiv identifier and paper password etc. will be send by email to the primary contact author specified in the metadata and the registered user, whose credentials were used for the deposit.","title":"2.

Individual authors may prefer arXiv\u2019s interactive web upload for personal use, because it provides better feedback mechanisms, but in principle the deposit API can be used for one-at-a-time deposit to arXiv by individual authors, too.

These are regular atom category elements. However to distinguish them from categories denoting secondary classification, they are specified via the arXiv extension element <primary_category xmlns=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom/\"> . There is also a long list of (optional) secondary categories, which are regular atom category elements. Specifying appropriate secondary classification gives submissions visibility in the relevant sub-communities of arXiv. A special feature of secondary categories for the Computer Science and Mathematics collections is that they include the ACM and MSC subject classifications respectively. Note: The available terms for ACM (D.2, F.1.1, etc.) and MSC (43A15, 62M10, etc.) classifications are not spelled out in the servicedocument. Authors have to determine the appropriate classification from publicly available listings and complete the term attribute accordingly. The servicedocument enumerates the available choices for each collection. As described below (see Initiate Ingestion ), the atom entry containing the metadata describing and completing a deposit to arXiv must have exactly one valid primary_category and can have zero or more secondary categories selected from those listed in the servicedocument. For example, the servicedocument lists the following choice of primary_categories for the Statistics collection : <collection href=\"https://arxiv.org/sword-app/stat-collection\"> <atom:title>The Statistics archive</atom:title> .... <arxiv:primary_categories fixed=\"yes\"> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.AP\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Applications\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.CO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Computation\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.ML\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Machine Learning\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.ME\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Methodology\"/> <arxiv:primary_category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/stat.TH\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Statistics - Theory\"/> </arxiv:primary_categories> ... </collection> and a deposit to /sword-app/stat-collection must contain exactly one of these. While arXiv categories are typically stable for months or years, sometimes existing categories are modified or re-assigned, and new categories are added. It is therefore recommended to periodically re-check the servicedocument for additions or modifications (note that arXiv returns a HTTP Expires header of 1 day).

Note : In particular for typical TeX submissions it is recommended to create a zip file of the TeX source files, macros, figures, etc and to deposit that as a single package. Other media deposits can be docx , pdf , (e)ps , jpg , png , etc., and it may be useful to individually deposit large figures or other material of substantial file size, instead of attempting to upload everything at once. A deposit is performed via POST to the appropriate collection URL selected from the servicedocument, e.g. a deposit of a jpg image to the Computer Science collection looks like POST https://arxiv.org/sword-app/cs-collection Host: arxiv.org User-Agent: arXiv SWORD demo 1.1 Content-Type: image/jpeg Authorization: Basic .......................= data stream .... The payload is the material to be deposited. Optionally there can be a X-On-Behalf-Of: HTTP header to specify the author of the material as opposed to the user making the deposit, along with other optional SWORD extensions headers, and in particular a md5 checksum in the Content-MD5: header to ensure integrity of the transferred data: POST https://arxiv.org/sword-app/cs-collection Host: arxiv.org User-Agent: arXiv SWORD demo 1.1 Content-Type: image/jpeg Content-MD5: p1T0tIZT/JyAgwevT+zHKw== Authorization: Basic .......................= data stream ...

Media Deposit"},{"location":"help/submit_sword.html#43-metadata-and-ingestion-initiation","text":"Once all components of a submission are deposited, the final step is to provide the metadata describing the content of the submission and referencing the previously deposited media entries. This is done by POST-ing a specially crafted atom entry with mime-type application/atom+xml;type=entry to the same collection URI as the previously posted media entries. The \u201cwrapper\u201d entry is an atom entry , as defined by the Atom Syndication Format ( RFC 4287 ), with certain mandatory and some optional extension elements. Most arXiv metadata elements have a direct mapping to standard atom entry elements, and these are used where possible. However arXiv metadata is richer than what the standard atom entry provides for. A detailed description of all arXiv entry elements can be found in the arXiv Atom API documentation. Note : A good way to understand the mapping of metadata between arXiv and atom is to look at examples. Compare the rendering of metadata for an arXiv paper as atom feed (XML) with the rendering as web page (XHTML) Apart from other requirements for an atom entry (id, updated, etc), the wrapper for a arXiv submission must contain Mandatory Elements <title> <author> <contributor> * <summary> <arxiv:primary_category \u2026> <link rel=related \u2026> * and may contain additional metadata, where available Optional Elements <category> * <arxiv:comment> <arxiv:journal_ref> * <arxiv:doi> <arxiv:report_no> * <arxiv:affiliation> * (* indicates repeatable elements) The <author> element is used for the authenticated user, i.e. the person who initiates the submission. The repeatable <contributor> element is used to specify the individual authors of the material being deposited to arXiv. At least one /contributor/email node must be present in order to inform arXiv of the email address of the primary contact author. If multiple /contributor/email nodes are found, the first will be used. Optionally the primary contact author\u2019s (name and) email address can also be specified in the X-On-Behalf-Of HTTP header extension, e.g.: X-On-Behalf-Of: \"A. Scientist\" <ascientist@institution.edu> This is useful to disambiguate when multiple /contributor/email nodes are present. The <arxiv:primary_category> must be selected from the list of available choices for the collection, as given in the servicedocument. The link(s) of relation \u201c related \u201d must refer to the previously deposited material. Title and summary have their obvious meaning. The summary must be at least 20 characters long. The title will be checked against other recently arXiv-ed papers to avoid inadvertent double submissions. Category element(s) can be used to provide secondary classification(s), selected from those listed in the servicedocument. Please refer to the arXiv submission help for explanation of the other optional fields. The \u201cwrapper\u201d is POST-ed to the same collection URI as the previously deposited media.

Acceptance of the wrapper does not imply that ingestion will be successful. Among other things there could be problems with moderator approval, classification, format conversion (e.g. TeX \u2192 PS, .docx \u2192 PDF, etc.), duplication detection, etc.. The eventual success or failure of ingestion will be communicated by email to the primary contact author (and optionally to the submitter/authenticated user). When applicable the email contains the permanent arXiv identifier and paper password. It is important that the author/submitter closely inspect the representation of the submission at arXiv and take corrective action where necessary, see checking . The status of a SWORD deposit may be tracked using the tracking URI returned in the Atom <link> element with rel=\"alternate\" , for example: <link rel=\"alternate\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/resolve/app/10030146\"/> The response to GET <http://arxiv.org/resolve/app/10030146> will be a short XML report on the status of this SWORD submission in the arXiv workflow.

The response will also include the final arXiv identifier in the <arxiv_id> element. on hold - The SWORD submission is in arXiv\u2019s workflow but was identified by arXiv administrators or moderators as needing further attention. incomplete - This status is not expected to be used for SWORD submissions.

Verification and Tracking"},{"location":"help/submit_sword.html#6-replacement","text":"arXiv\u2019ed papers can be updated or replaced. The rules for a replacement via the web interface also apply to a replacement using SWORD. In particular a new version number will be assigned unless it is a same day replacement , and all previously published versions remain accessible. For a replacement of a previously created resource via SWORD/APP arXiv uses the \u201cEditing Resources with PUT \u201d functionality as outlined in the SWORD specification and specifically RFC5023 section 9.3 applied to the metadata wrapper of the original deposit. A replacement via SWORD can only be made by a registered paper owner or the author of the original SWORD deposit when authenticated with the same credentials. There are no per paper passwords for replacements via SWORD. Most of the mechanics of the replacement are the same as those of a new SWORD deposit. Steps for a replacement First all the media resources should be individually posted or deposited packed together into a zip file. Previously deposited media resources in the workspace of the authenticated user can be referenced via their edit-media links, e.g. <link rel=\"edit-media\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/........\"/> if they have not expired yet. arXiv retains individual media deposits via SWORD for at least 30 days. Then a metadata wrapper is PUT to the link with rel=\"edit\u201d which was part of the atom entry response to the original wrapper deposit, e.g. <link rel=\"edit\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/09011841.atom\"/> The metadata wrapper is constructed in similar fashion as for a new submission, however it must be deposited using PUT to the link with rel=\u201cedit\u201d that was returned upon original submission.

Content-Type: application/atom+xml;type=entry along with an atom entry in the response content confirming acceptance. Notes : To replace a paper using the permanent arXiv identifier ( <id> ), submit the metadata wrapper via PUT to https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/<id> e.g. for arXiv:0708.0123 use PUT to https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/0708.0123 and for arXiv:cond-mat/9904123 use PUT to https://arxiv.org/sword-app/edit/cond-mat/9904123 arXiv does not permit the classification of an article to be changed during a replacement operation. The arxiv:primary_category element must match the existing primary category. The replacment metadata may contain either no category elements, or a set of category elements that matches the existing categories. The authenticated user must > be the paper owner. Ownership can be claimed with the paper password .","title":"6. Replacement"},{"location":"help/submit_sword.html#7-error-conditions-and-error-codes","text":"Error handling is outlined in Part A.5 of the SWORD specification , where a SWORD extension element to AtomPub called sword:error is introduced. This allows for a much more informative error message in addition to the regular HTTP 4xx and 5xx status codes which are part of the base protocol. arXiv uses this mechanism to provide informative error messages in the body of the error response along with a corresponding numeric error code and a href attribute. The error response content is a regular atom entry with a root element of sword:error , a href attribute containing a URI which identifies the error, a human readable error presented in the summary element and the numeric error code in the arxiv:errorcode extension element.

This is a complex task, and the processing does not always lead to the desired or expected results. It is important for you, the author/submitter, to carefully check and verify the resulting PDF. You will be required to view the PDF during the submission process before you will be able to complete your submission. You can submit a collection of TeX input/include files, e.g. separate chapters, foreword, appendix, etc, and custom macros ( see below ) packaged in a (possibly compressed) .tar or .zip file. AutoTeX will generally figure out how to properly process multi-part submissions, and you don't need to adhere to special packaging rules or naming conventions for your tex files. However, there are certain caveats. Naming your primary (or toplevel) file ms.tex will cause AutoTeX to always process that file first. Otherwise, tex files will be processed in alphanumeric order. That said, it is important that you do not include extraneous files (including unused figure files), leftover files, backup files, anything which does not belong to the paper you are submitting or is not needed for processing. Do not include journal templates, referee letters, or man pages. Tidy your submission before you pack it up. You must submit any figures that go along with your paper. We recommend that you use appropriate TeX commands to include the figures inline with your paper (see below), as this is more readable than separate or appended figures. Note: In the past, it was possible to include a generic arXiv identifier in the TeX source that the processor would automatically translate into the identifier of the current submission. This practice is no longer necessary, nor supported. All TeX-type submissions receive the arXiv watermark, including the canonical identifier, version number, primary classification, and a link back to the correct version on the arXiv site. Again, arch-ive/yymmnnn (and, by extension, yymm.nnnnn ) will not be translated to the correct identifier for your submission. Considerations for (La)TeX submissions By default, LaTeX files are processed using LaTeX2e (the current version of LaTeX). Although there is a LaTeX2.09 compatibility mode, it is highly recommended that you use LaTeX2e whenever possible, to take advantage of all its features and improvements and to avoid complications which may arise in compatibility mode (note that LaTeX2e has been the default latex version for many years). If you have a file named foo.tex, then do not include any associated auxiliary file or intermediate or resulting output file, e.g. foo.ps (or foo.aux, foo.log, foo.toc, foo.lot, foo.lof, foo.dvi, foo.pdf) in your submission. These will be automatically removed to allow the creation of an output file from your TeX file. Index ( .ind ) and processed bibtex ( .bbl ) files are an exception, see below . Figure inclusion in LaTeX submissions Note that TeX/LaTeX can only include (encapsulated) PostScript ( .ps or .eps ), figures directly. Other formats are not supported in native (La)TeX. See Useful Software for figure conversion tools. If you are making use of PDFLaTeX you may embed your .pdf, .png, .jpg figures using the same mechanisms. The most flexible and robust figure inclusion is provided by the graphics and graphicx packages and the \\includegraphics command defined therein. We highly recommend you use them for your figure inclusion. arXiv does not provide the psfig package any longer. You must include your own psfig.sty if you use it. In general, if things go wrong or don't look as desired you may have to include your version of older macros . Note that some software will permit you to include a mix of PostScript and PDFLaTeX-compatible figures and will perform the conversions to the appropriate format for you on the fly. arXiv does not permit such software to run during the AutoTeX processing. Why? It is possible for conversion issues to arise that can alter the scientific meaning or interpretation of your figure. Rather than invite such possibilities, we require that you use a unified figure format. Separate figures with LaTeX submissions Figures in jpeg , png , or gif format may be submitted alongside native (La)TeX submissions provided that they are not included in the source file.. PDF or other formats not listed above are not permitted with (La)TeX submission; use PDFLaTeX instead for PDF, jpeg, or png figures. Figures which are not incorporated in the main body of the paper will be listed separately. They should be given names of the form figure<number><optional letter>.ext , e.g. figure1.jpg , figure2a.gif , figure2b.png , so that they can be automatically sorted into the correct order for the \"combined figures\" link. Figure inclusion in plain TeX For plain TeX submissions, use the plain tex interface to the graphics package ( graphicx.tex ) or a macro package like epsf or epsfig . arXiv does not presently support PDFTeX. Considerations for PDFLaTeX submissions arXiv fully supports and automatically recognizes PDFLaTeX. You can ensure pdflatex processing by setting the flag \\pdfoutput=1 within the first 5 lines of the preamble of the main .tex file. You should not need any other special flag. Should you need conditional branching in your source, use the ifpdf package. Do not re-invent the wheel. ifpdf provides a robust and well tested mechanism to distinguish between pdflatex in pdf mode and other modes or engines. Some packages may require a particular back-end driver, in the form of a package option, e.g. \\usepackage[pdftex]{...} . However, the graphics and hyperref packages determine the proper driver automatically; you don't have to make this explicit choice and should not do so to avoid conflicts. You can use the full range of pdf specific hypertex options to augment metadata in the PDF file, e.g. \\hypersetup{pdfauthor={some author},pdftitle={eye-catching title}} . Figures can be included in JPEG , PNG , or PDF format with the standard graphics package. For security reasons arXiv does not allow for automated format conversion, so your figures must be in the proper format already. Unlike native LaTeX, the default output format for PDFLaTeX is PDF, with no intermediate DVI or PostScript. Thus, these formats are not available for download for PDFLaTeX submissions. We probably have your style files or macros You probably do not need to submit any style files since we have copies of all the common scientific style files. Try submitting without style files. If you find that this does not work because we do not have the style file you need, then you can include the necessary style file in your submission and resubmit. Note: A&A, pstricks, elsart, and by now to a lesser degree AMSLaTeX , iopart, and revtex4 users, you may need to include your own version of those style/class files with your submission. arXiv can process standard zip and tar files. Simply bundle the necessary files together with your (La-)TeX file(s) in the same directory (or do a less convenient multi-file submission). Do not ask us to update those particular style and class files in our installation. They are not backwards compatible. Do not submit in double-spaced \"referee\" mode Avoid inadvertently submitting your paper in double-spaced referee mode, since it wastes paper on a global scale. Readers prefer to have a compact single-spaced version, as it would appear in a printed journal. Prepare the references carefully We strongly encourage you to include arXiv's YYMM.NNNNN , identifiers in your reference list for both published and unpublished papers. Note also that many publishers allow e-print identifiers to appear in the references of papers submitted. If you use standard identifiers of the form 1510.00322, arXiv:1510.00322, 0901.0512, arXiv:0901.0512, hep-ph/9409201 or arXiv:hep-ph/9409201, they can be easily harvested by automatic software. For example, \\bedim{upsilon} C.T.H. Davies {\\em et al.}, Phys. Rev {\\bf D} 50 (1994) 6963, hep-lat/9406017. Do not include extraneous font commands, spaces, tildes, braces or line-breaks within the e-print identifier: this will cause your references to be missed by automated extraction software. See also notes about references to and in arXiv documents and collection of references at INSPIRE . Use of e-print identifiers is a significant aid to the INSPIRE database. It also facilitates automatic network hyperlinks of references from within papers. If you use BibTeX there are some BibTeX styles which support e-print identifiers (see BibTeX and Eprints ). If you are submitting a group of .tex files, automated reference extraction by INSPIRE and others will be more accurate and faster if your references are all in one file. This file should have the \\begin{thebibliography} or similar command within it, and should be called foo.bbl to correspond to a given foo.tex source file. Include .bbl files if you use BibTeX We do not run BibTeX in the auto-TeXing procedure. If you use it, include in your submission the .bbl file that BibTeX produces on your own machine; otherwise your references will not come out correctly. We do not run BibTeX because the .bib database files can be quite large, and the only thing necessary to resolve the references for a given paper is the .bbl file. You may still include them if you wish, but they must also match your .tex file name. The name of the .bbl file must match the name of the main .tex file for the system to process the references correctly. Note that packages such as xr and xref that rely on the \\externaldocument command will not work in arXiv. They require the presence of a .aux file in order to set up their linking structure. Since our AutoTeX system deletes the .aux files between tex runs, packages that need these files to be present will not function correctly, and will not report any critical error during processing. Instead we require that you update your .bbl files to include the appropriate references for both documents. Include .ind files if you use makeindex We do not run makeindex in the auto-TeXing procedure. If you use it, include in your submission the .ind file that makeindex produces on your own machine; otherwise your index will not appear. It is difficult to automatically perform makeindex processing to the authors' expectations because of the multiple optional arguments and optional style selections. Therefore arXiv asks authors to provide their pre-processed .ind file(s) along with their (La)TeX source file(s). Include your .gls if you use a glossary Similar to index files, we do not process .glo into the resultant .gls files. You must provide these files if you have any special nomenclature in your document. How to include supplemental material TeX-based supplemental material should be included in the main document root directory, and will be compiled into the final output pdf. Both files must use the same TeX-engine (either both latex, both pdflatex, or both plain tex). The final output will be assembled in alphanumeric order. For example, given the following files: ./ms.tex ./ms.bbl ./myfig.eps ./supplement.tex ./supplement.bbl contained within your .zip or .tar.gz file the final pdf would place the contents of your ms.tex file first. We recommend assembling your files in this manner rather than placing any compiled pdf into an ancillary files directory, as these are not indexed for discovery and access. Note that adding a 00README.XXX with a toplevelfile directive will only effect the processing order and not the final assembly order of the pdf. We highly recommend that if you plan to include any non-TeX files with your source package that you include them as ancillary files inside their own /anc directory off your document's root directory. For additional information please see that help page . For legacy reasons, we still support individual file inclusion, as follows. If your submission includes any plain text files which should not be processed (e.g. Fortran source code, data files), and you don't want them available for separate download as ancillary files then make the first line of those files %auto-ignore This ensures that they will be ignored by the auto-postscript generator. NOTE : pdflatex users who submit using the above formatting recommendations will have any final hyperlinking removed due to a known issue in the pdfpages.sty package. Avoid mistakes in the text Common mistakes can be avoided by following some simple guidelines . If your submission does not TeX properly, you will receive the log from our auto-TeXing script at the Process step. The information contained in this complete log should be sufficient to identify the problem, so examine it carefully; check the end of the log for TeX errors. Problems with special TeX characters in hyperlinks (URLs) -- in particular JHEP3.cls If hyperlinks for URLs containing '#' appear as '\\#' in arXiv generated PDF, the macro package being used to generate these hyperlinks does not properly escape special characters in pdf strings. Either use the hyperref package or define the URLs with the following workaround: instead of e.g. : \\href{http://example.com/some-page.html\\#destination}{destination} use: \\href{http://example.com/some-page.html\\string#destination}{destination} If you use macros like: \\newcommand{\\link}[2]{\\href{http://example.com/some-page.html\\##1}\\egroup \\newcommand{\\link}[2]{\\href{http://example.com/some-page.html\\hash #1}{ #2} instead. Hidden files will be deleted upon announcement Please do not use hidden files or directories in your source package. These hidden files (i.e. files or directories beginning with a period character, such as .cache/ ) will be deleted upon announcement, but may work at the Process or Preview submission stages. The rationale being that such files may cruft from version control systems, etc. and should not be a part of an archival version of your source. This means that any packages that allow for or rely upon these structures (e.g. minted.sty ) may function on your machine, but will fail once announced.","title":"Submit tex"},{"location":"help/submit_tex.html#considerations-for-tex-submissions","text":"Submissions are automatically processed Considerations for (La)TeX submissions Considerations for PDFLaTeX submissions We probably have your style files or macros Do not submit in double-spaced \"referee\" mode Prepare the references carefully Include .bbl files if you use BibTeX Include .ind files if you used makeindex Include .gls files if you have a glossary Supplemental material Avoid mistakes in the text Problems with special TeX characters in hyperlinks (URLs) -- in particular JHEP3.cls Hidden files will be deleted upon announcement","title":"Considerations for TeX Submissions"},{"location":"help/submit_tex.html#submissions-are-automatically-processed","text":"Your (La)TeX, AMS(La)TeX, or PDFLaTeX submission will be processed automatically by our AutoTeX software.

These circumstances include: Proxy submissions from our partner site HAL , operated by CCSD in France. Open access archiving arrangements with recognized journals and societies such as the Institute of Mathematical Statistics . Automated deposit of conference proceedings from conference management systems. Such deposit is currently support by the Microsoft Conference Management Toolkit (e.g. articles from CIDR2007: arXiv:cs/0612137 , arXiv:cs/0612129 ,...). Proxy submissions from overlay journals such as EPTCS . Submissions by administrative assistants etc., though discouraged, are permitted. Please ensure that an author checks the submission is correct in time to notify arXiv administrators of any problem before announcement. In the case that the assistant uses the author's account then no special arrangements with arXiv need to be made. Remember that submissions cannot be removed once announced , changes may be made only by replacement which creates a new version and will not erase the original. Proxy submission requirements arXiv has special facilities for proxy submitters. Potential proxy submitters must contact arXiv administrators explaining the circumstances for their request of proxy privileges, and confirming that the requirements below will be met. Proxy submitters must provide a valid contact email address to a reliable and named contact person when creating an arXiv account. Articles are subject to arXiv's moderation process. Articles must be classified individually and carefully based on their content rather than being submitted to a category based solely on the focus of the conference or journal in which they appear. Articles that are not appropriate to a category within arXiv must not be submitted. Metadata must be validated by an author of the article prior to submission (provide details from, or links to, arXiv preparation instructions ). Submissions may be made either manually via arXiv's normal submission interface (see submission help ) or via our automated SWORD interface (see SWORD help and contact arXiv administrators for permission). An email address for the corresponding author must be provided with each submission (this will be requested in addition to other metadata when submissions are made via proxy submission accounts; it is a separate metadata field for SWORD deposits). Proxy submitters must not make more that 10 submissions in a day without prior approval from arXiv administrators (this rule avoids overloading arXiv administrators and moderators; excessive numbers of submissions may simply be removed from the queue en masse ). When submitting TeX source, the complete source files (see TeX source help ) must be provided to enable processing . When author-produced PDF is submitted, only the PDF file should be uploaded ( PDF submission help ). There are some test facilities for those developing new SWORD upload software or to check particular TeX processing requirements. Contact arXiv administrators if you have a need for these facilities. Proxy submission privileges may be revoked temporarily or permanently if a proxy submitter violates these rules or otherwise causes excessive numbers of problems. If in doubt, please ask arXiv administrators and wait for a response before attempting anything that might create additional work or disrupt arXiv operation.","title":"Third party submission"},{"location":"help/third_party_submission.html#third-party-submission","text":"In general author self-submission is preferred because our experience shows that there are far fewer errors and misunderstandings than with submissions made by third-parties.

Proxy submissions from overlay journals such as EPTCS . Submissions by administrative assistants etc., though discouraged, are permitted. Please ensure that an author checks the submission is correct in time to notify arXiv administrators of any problem before announcement. In the case that the assistant uses the author's account then no special arrangements with arXiv need to be made. Remember that submissions cannot be removed once announced , changes may be made only by replacement which creates a new version and will not erase the original.","title":"Third party submission"},{"location":"help/third_party_submission.html#proxy-submission-requirements","text":"arXiv has special facilities for proxy submitters. Potential proxy submitters must contact arXiv administrators explaining the circumstances for their request of proxy privileges, and confirming that the requirements below will be met. Proxy submitters must provide a valid contact email address to a reliable and named contact person when creating an arXiv account. Articles are subject to arXiv's moderation process. Articles must be classified individually and carefully based on their content rather than being submitted to a category based solely on the focus of the conference or journal in which they appear. Articles that are not appropriate to a category within arXiv must not be submitted. Metadata must be validated by an author of the article prior to submission (provide details from, or links to, arXiv preparation instructions ). Submissions may be made either manually via arXiv's normal submission interface (see submission help ) or via our automated SWORD interface (see SWORD help and contact arXiv administrators for permission). An email address for the corresponding author must be provided with each submission (this will be requested in addition to other metadata when submissions are made via proxy submission accounts; it is a separate metadata field for SWORD deposits). Proxy submitters must not make more that 10 submissions in a day without prior approval from arXiv administrators (this rule avoids overloading arXiv administrators and moderators; excessive numbers of submissions may simply be removed from the queue en masse ). When submitting TeX source, the complete source files (see TeX source help ) must be provided to enable processing . When author-produced PDF is submitted, only the PDF file should be uploaded ( PDF submission help ). There are some test facilities for those developing new SWORD upload software or to check particular TeX processing requirements. Contact arXiv administrators if you have a need for these facilities. Proxy submission privileges may be revoked temporarily or permanently if a proxy submitter violates these rules or otherwise causes excessive numbers of problems. If in doubt, please ask arXiv administrators and wait for a response before attempting anything that might create additional work or disrupt arXiv operation.","title":"Proxy submission requirements"},{"location":"help/toc.html","text":"","title":"Toc"},{"location":"help/trackback.html","text":"Trackbacks arXiv.org supports the Trackback standard.

In order to save network bandwidth and disk space, submissions are compressed. arXiv uses the gzip and tar utilities. See our detailed utilities help for instructions on obtaining gzip and tar. Papers downloaded from the web will be packed in one of two ways: as a gzipped TeX file (for downloads consisting of a single file only), or as a gzipped tar file (for downloads consisting of multiple files). In either case, the first step is to gunzip the file (though this may not be necessary; see below). A tarred file should then be untarred . If you do not have tar or gunzip you will have to install them; see our utilities help for information on how to obtain tar and gzip programs for different platforms. Unpacking Gzipped Files Note: Many browsers will gunzip downloaded files automatically, so that the instructions in this section can be ignored. However, a problem may arise if the resulting file is not renamed properly by the web browser. The utility gunzip, which decompresses files in several different compression formats, is always made available with gzip. To uncompress the file using gunzip on a Unix/Linux command line, do: $ gunzip filename.gz for gzipped single PostScript or TeX files, or $ gunzip filename.tar.gz for tarred, gzipped multi-file packages. This will create a file named filename in the former case, or filename.tar in the latter. The filename.gz file will be deleted. Unpacking a Tarred Package If you have a .tar file at this stage, then you must untar it. On the Unix command line you do the following: $ tar -xvf filename.tar The various files contained in the tar file are extracted by this command. You will see them listed as they are extracted. At this point you will have one or more TeX files and probably some figure files, and you will have to run TeX as necessary to produce output that you can print or view on the screen.

TeX has many advantages that make it ideal as a format for the archives: It is plain text, it is compact, it is freely available for all platforms, it produces extremely high-quality output, and it retains contextual information . It is thus more likely to be a good source from which to generate newer formats, e.g., MathML (namely HTML, or more specifically XML, that handles mathematics correctly -- note that the MathML people plan a LaTeX to MathML translator, but dvi/ps/pdf lack the necessary document structuring concepts). Possession of the source thus provides many additional options for future document migrations. Using emerging new technology, most of the Postscript generated from the source contains hyperlinks , so that using new versions of PostScript previewers (e.g., the next version of Ghostscript/Ghostview), readers can point-and-click to navigate within the paper, and even over the web itself. And by archiving the source, we maximize the potential for seamless adoption of future technological improvements. Archived papers can be repeatedly rejuvenated by automated reprocessing. We distill the source into Adobe's PDF format. The hyperlinks can then be viewed using Acroread or an equivalent reader . In addition, this means that the hyperlink overlay will be directly available to those web browsers with built-in PDF support (thus combining the network transport capabilities of html with a more serious page markup language). Having the paper available in PDF means that problems discussed below with Mac and PC browsers can be avoided. There is no single Postscript standard! We provide Postscript in many formats; this is not possible if the author submits a single Postscript file. For a historical example, Preview.app under NeXTstep displayed bitmapped fonts poorly, and for historical reasons (TeX predated common use of Postscript) these fonts are still most commonly used by TeX and dvips. By requesting type 1 fonts from the \"More options\" page, screen readability is improved. Cross-referencing within arXiv is added automatically with hyperlinked Postscript. Authors should specify arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN or the older format of arch-ive/papernum (e.g., hep-ph/9503456) references whenever available, and these strings will be pattern-matched and replaced with suitable hyperlinks back to arXiv. Similarly, any occurrences of http://... or ftp://... url's are detected and converted to hyperlinks. What is \"Contextual\" Information, and Why is it Important? We mean by this the relationship between equations and their labels, references and their numbers, subsection headings and their entries in the table of contents, and so on. While ordinarily readily available in TeX/LaTex source, conversion to Postscript irretrievably loses this structural information. The loss is unfortunate because with new formats such as PDF, the information can be used to provide active hyperlinks: e.g., in a PDF viewer you can click on an equation number and jump back to the specified equation. Moreover TeX itself can be processed as HyperTeX and, with the proper dvi previewer, clicking on equation numbers will bring up the desired equation in a separate window, or even retrieve other papers specified by their proper arch-ive/papernum identifier. HyperTeX works by redefining the standard macros and works retroactively for pre-existing TeX/LaTeX source -- HyperTeX conversion is accomplished by merely re-TeXing with the modified macros. Since information is ordinarily lost in each stage of processing, TeX source contains (close to) the maximal amount of contextual information that can be retroactively processed into any future format which can take advantage of it. For more information, see https://arxiv.org/hypertex/ . Why doesn't arXiv Accept Preprocessed Postscript Submissions? Postscript from TeX usually contains bitmapped fonts at a fixed resolution. Your favorite resolution is inappropriate for other users and may make your paper difficult or impossible to read. We will make available many versions of the Postscript including 300 dpi, 400 dpi, or 600 dpi bitmapped fonts, as well as Postscript with (un-embedded) Type 1 fonts. Different dvi to PS drivers produce Postscript that ranges from completely non-compliant with Adobe's Document Structuring Comments to only marginally compliant. We will always have the latest dvi to PS software installed and will produce DSC compliant PS. Postscript loses contextual information that is implicit in the TeX. This information is required to provide hyperlinked overlays to papers (so that users with the proper viewers can, for example, click on a reference number and jump to the reference, which can also include a web URL which can be automatically passed off to a web browser). To do the hyperlinking, we use HyperTeX macros. The Postscript we produce is HyperPostscript which can be distilled into Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). Our software makes web URL's out of all references of the form YYMM.NNNNN or arch-ive/yymmnnn (e.g., 1510.00322 will be converted to a hyperlink for https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00322, hep-th/9511053 will be converted to a hyperlink for https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9511053). TeX source is more compact and space-efficient. Frequent Red Herring Concerns: Will the auto-TeXing embed figures? Yes. Our TeX installation can do anything that yours can. Any macros you use that we do not support can be included in your submission (or sent to us separately so we can put them on-line). Won't TeX source make it easy to plagiarize? There is no file format or other technological device that can protect you from this. At the very least, unscrupulous re-typers would always remain a threat. Postscript does not provide a barrier in any event: it is quite simple for someone with a little knowledge to extract any text from a Postscript file. Moreover a plagiarist who cuts-and-pastes directly from your TeX source is all the more easily detected, since the source is easily identified. We archive all versions of papers so that we can assist in any priority or plagiarism disputes. I worked hard to make my figures and I don't want people to steal them. Shouldn't I hide them by embedding them? As with the above question, it is quite easy for someone with a little knowledge to extract anything they like from the output PDF or Posctript file. Furthermore, unauthorized or un-attributed use of figures counts as plagiarism, just as above, so the rest of the above discussion applies here as well. What if my TeX source has potentially embarrassing self-comments in it? Well... you should probably take them out. It is easy to strip these out in advance of submitting. Here is a Perl filter to do it. Please, please do not hurt yourself with this script; save your file and do not write over the backup copy... just in case. #!/usr/local/bin/perl while(<STDIN>){ s/^\\%.*$/\\%/; s/([^\\\\])\\%.*$/\\1\\%/g; print; } exit(0); or use the one line command perl -pe 's/(^|[^\\\\])%.*/\\1%/' < old.tex > new.tex I use the Textures program.

It is thus more likely to be a good source from which to generate newer formats, e.g., MathML (namely HTML, or more specifically XML, that handles mathematics correctly -- note that the MathML people plan a LaTeX to MathML translator, but dvi/ps/pdf lack the necessary document structuring concepts).

The goal of the API is to allow application developers access to all of the arXiv data, search and linking facilities with an easy-to-use programmatic interface. This page provides links to developer documentation, and gives instructions for how to join the mailing list and contact other developers and maintainers. Please review the Terms of Use for arXiv APIs before using the arXiv API. For more news and questions about the arXiv API, please see our arxiv-api group . Additional information is also in the API FAQ . About the arXiv API Quickstart Using the arXiv API arXiv API documentation Community About the arXiv API The Cornell University e-print arXiv, hosted at arXiv.org , is a document submission and retrieval system that is heavily used by the physics, mathematics and computer science communities. It has become the primary means of communicating cutting-edge manuscripts on current and ongoing research. The open-access arXiv e-print repository is available worldwide, and presents no entry barriers to readers, thus facilitating scholarly communication. Manuscripts are often submitted to the arXiv before they are published by more traditional means. In some cases they may never be submitted or published elsewhere, and in others, arXiv-hosted manuscripts are used as the submission channel to traditional publishers such as the American Physical Society, and newer forms of publication such as the Journal for High Energy Physics and overlay journals. The primary interface to the arXiv has been human-oriented html web pages. The purpose of the arXiv API is to allow programmatic access to the arXiv's e-print content and metadata. The goal of the interface is to facilitate new and creative use of the the vast body of material on the arXiv by providing a low barrier to entry for application developers. Quickstart API calls are made via an HTTP GET or POST requests to an appropriate url. For example, the url http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron retrieves results that match the search query all:electron . This url can be accessed from any web-enabled client including your web browser, or via web libraries common to almost all programming languages. There is no arXiv-supplied software that must be downloaded and installed to be able to use the api. Please see Using the arXiv API , or the User's Manual for more information. Using the arXiv API Since the arXiv API is based on the now ubiquitous HTTP, using it should be fairly straight forward from the programming language of your choice. The primary access point for the api is a url that encodes your desired search parameters. For example, the url: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=0&max_results=10 indicates that you want to use the api query interface to retrieve the first ten results that match the query all:electron . This url calls the api, which returns the results in the Atom 1.0 format. Atom 1.0 is an xml-based format that is commonly used in website syndication feeds. It is lightweight, and human readable, and results can be cleanly read in many web browsers. For detailed information on Atom, you can read the official Atom 1.0 specification . We recommend that you use a web browser such as to play around with constructing the api url's to get a feel for how the system works. This is also a great debugging tool to make sure your url's make sense to the api. Firefox renders Atom particularly cleanly. More detailed documentation on constructing API urls can be found in the User's Manual . Once you have familiarized yourself with the api, you should be able to easily write programs that call the API automatically. Most programming languages, if not all, have libraries that allow you to make HTTP requests. Since Atom is growing, not all languages have libraries that support Atom parsing, so most of the programming effort will be in digesting the responses you receive. The languages that we know of that can easily handle calling the api via HTTP and parsing the results include: Perl (via XML::Atom ) ( example ) Python (via feedparser ) ( example ) Ruby (via feedtools ) ( example ) PHP (via SimplePie ) ( example ) Below we include code snippets for these languages that perform the bare minimum functionality - calling the api and printing the raw Atom results. See the documentation and example programs for more detailed examples. If your favorite language is not up here, write us with an example, and we'll be glad to post it! For more detailed examples in these languages which cover more advanced API programming, please see the User's Manual .

The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 115 pb-1. Di-electron and tri-electron event yields are measured. Cross sections are derived in a restricted phase space region dominated by photon-photon collisions. In general good agreement is found with the Standard Model predictions. However, for electron pair invariant masses above 100 GeV, three di-electron events and three tri-electron events are observed, compared to Standard Model expectations of 0.30 \\pm 0.04 and 0.23 \\pm 0.04, respectively. </summary> <author xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <name xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">H1 Collaboration</name> </author> <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">23 pages, 8 figures and 4 tables</arxiv:comment> <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Eur.Phys.J.

This url calls the api, which returns the results in the Atom 1.0 format. Atom 1.0 is an xml-based format that is commonly used in website syndication feeds. It is lightweight, and human readable, and results can be cleanly read in many web browsers. For detailed information on Atom, you can read the official Atom 1.0 specification . We recommend that you use a web browser such as to play around with constructing the api url's to get a feel for how the system works. This is also a great debugging tool to make sure your url's make sense to the api. Firefox renders Atom particularly cleanly. More detailed documentation on constructing API urls can be found in the User's Manual . Once you have familiarized yourself with the api, you should be able to easily write programs that call the API automatically. Most programming languages, if not all, have libraries that allow you to make HTTP requests. Since Atom is growing, not all languages have libraries that support Atom parsing, so most of the programming effort will be in digesting the responses you receive. The languages that we know of that can easily handle calling the api via HTTP and parsing the results include: Perl (via XML::Atom ) ( example ) Python (via feedparser ) ( example ) Ruby (via feedtools ) ( example ) PHP (via SimplePie ) ( example ) Below we include code snippets for these languages that perform the bare minimum functionality - calling the api and printing the raw Atom results. See the documentation and example programs for more detailed examples. If your favorite language is not up here, write us with an example, and we'll be glad to post it! For more detailed examples in these languages which cover more advanced API programming, please see the User's Manual . All of the simple examples produce an output which looks like: Example: A Typical Atom Response (wrapped for ease of reading, issue query now ) <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\" xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" href=\"http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/> <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">ArXiv Query: search_query=all:electron&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1</title> <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">http://arxiv.org/api/cHxbiOdZaP56ODnBPIenZhzg5f8</id> <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2007-10-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated> <opensearch:totalResults xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1000</opensearch:totalResults> <opensearch:startIndex xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">0</opensearch:startIndex> <opensearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1</opensearch:itemsPerPage> <entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0307015</id> <published xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2003-07-07T13:46:39-04:00</published> <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2003-07-07T13:46:39-04:00</updated> <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">Multi-Electron Production at High Transverse Momenta in ep Collisions at HERA</title> <summary xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> Multi-electron production is studied at high electron transverse momentum in positron- and electron-proton collisions using the H1 detector at HERA. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 115 pb-1. Di-electron and tri-electron event yields are measured. Cross sections are derived in a restricted phase space region dominated by photon-photon collisions. In general good agreement is found with the Standard Model predictions. However, for electron pair invariant masses above 100 GeV, three di-electron events and three tri-electron events are observed, compared to Standard Model expectations of 0.30 \\pm 0.04 and 0.23 \\pm 0.04, respectively. </summary> <author xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <name xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">H1 Collaboration</name> </author> <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">23 pages, 8 figures and 4 tables</arxiv:comment> <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Eur.Phys.J.

Preface This API allows for automatic text classification according to the categorization scheme used by arXiv . 2. The arXiv Categorization scheme Research articles submitted to arXiv are categorized according to a classification scheme that has slowly evolved out of requirements of the involved research communities, user and moderator feedback, and input from the arXiv scientific advisory board . This scheme allows for targeted browsing of subsections of new submissions, subscription to particular channels, higher relevance of specific listings to the user\u2019s interests. It also allows to narrow down searches, etc.. 3. Automatic Classification So far arXiv has relied on appropriate author self classification of new submissions with guidance and occasional correction by moderators and other feedback mechanisms. Recently automatic classification of new submissions via comparison to the existing body of nearly 600,000 previously classified research articles in arXiv\u2019s holdings has become feasible with sufficient accuracy. arXiv has implemented two algorithms to provide a best match classification and accompanying score based on the full text of an article. These are based on the common TF-IDF-cosine distance measure and the asymmetric Kullback\u2013Leibler divergence. We decided to make these publicly available via a simple API, so that third parties and in particular authoring tools supporting submission to arXiv can determine the likely classification of a piece of text or intended submission. 4. Description of the API Both the arXiv API and the SWORD/APP submission interface are using Atom , and we decided to build on that and provide classification information via an Atom feed response to a standard HTTP POST of a PDF file or a (fragment of) plain text to http://export.arxiv.org/api/classify For demonstration purposes this link issues a sample query for text=\"kinematics and dynamics of stellar disks\" and returns the corresponding categorization feed. The response is a feed which contains Atom entries encoding the likely classification in an <atom:category> element, e.g. <category term=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/astro-ph.CO\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/terms/arXiv/\" label=\"Physics - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics\"/> and the numerical score in a score extension element in the arxiv namespace _xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" , e.g. <arxiv:score>0.02412488927537541</arxiv:score> In addition the <atom:title\\> element of the entry contains the rank, a human readable form of the category, and the score in parentheses, e.g. <title>4: Astrophysics - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics (0.024)</title> The category element has the same form as used in the SWORD/APP deposit api. This should allow for straightforward integration with (existing) SWORD clients, which can directly use the classification term(s) for the category element(s) of a submission in progress. Users who are registered for access to the arXiv SWORD API can obtain a list of available classifications from the SWORD Servicedocument 5. Optional Parameters There are 2 optional parameters which can be specified as key-value pairs in the request URI. They control the scoring method and the number of results returned. Parameters scoring_method Currently arxiv supports 2 different scoring methods. The asymmetric Kullback Leibler divergence ( asymKL ) and the TF-IDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) cosine distance ( tfidfcosine ). The default is asymKL . max_entries This determines the maximum number of entries returned in the feed. The default is 10 .

Providing free Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) helps us to advance that mission by enabling platforms and projects that extend the discoverability of arXiv e-prints and provide valuable services to scientists and interested readers. Our APIs include our OAI-PMH interface , RSS feeds , the legacy arXiv API , bulk data downloads , SWORD bulk deposit API , and services available via the arXiv API Gateway . Understanding and observing the following terms of use will help us to ensure that arXiv continues to be able to fulfill its mission. For more information, see arXiv\u2019s Operating Principles . By using arXiv APIs, you are agreeing to the terms and conditions outlined on this page. You understand that e-prints from arXiv are subject to all applicable copyright protections. The redistribution of e-prints requires permission from the copyright holder, which may be the author(s) or publisher. arXiv is not the copyright holder on any of the e-prints available through the API. In some cases, submitters have provided permission in advance by submitting their e-print under a permissive Creative Commons license. The vast majority of e-prints are submitted under the arXiv.org non-exclusive right to distribute . For more information about licenses, see https://arxiv.org/help/license. You are free to use descriptive metadata 1 about arXiv e-prints under the terms of the Creative Commons Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Declaration .

You agree to respect limitations on use of arXiv APIs, including rate limits and authorization mechanisms. If we think that you are attempting to circumvent those limitations, that your use of arXiv APIs threatens normal operation or availability of the arXiv platform, or that you are doing something illegal or unethical, we may further limit or block your access. You understand that we will make changes to arXiv APIs that may lead to compatibility issues with your code. We will do our best to provide advance notice of such changes via our website and the arXiv API group . It is up to you to keep track of changes that might affect your use of arXiv APIs and to make any required changes. In order to provide support and improvements for developers who use arXiv APIs, you understand that we will collect certain private information about you, such as your name and email address. Please see the arXiv Privacy Policy for information about how we use and protect your information. In order to promote use of arXiv APIs and showcase your work, we may give you the option to make information about you or your project publicly available. Limitations Rate limits Please note that the following rate limits apply to all of the machines under your control as a whole. You should not attempt to overcome these limits by increasing the number of machines used to make requests. If your use-case requires a higher request rate, please contact our support team at help@arxiv.org. When using the legacy APIs (including OAI-PMH, RSS, and the arXiv API), make no more than one request every three seconds, and limit requests to a single connection at a time. When using services via the arXiv API Gateway, make no more than 4 requests per second per connection, and limit requests to four connections at a time. These limits may change in the future. Authentication & Authorization In order to use services available via the arXiv API Gateway, you must obtain an authentication token that can be used in OAuth2 authentication workflows . We expect you to follow OAuth2 protocols, and not attempt to circumvent those workflows. We expect you to not share your authentication credentials with others, or to use someone else\u2019s credentials. Things that you can (and should!) do Retrieve, store, transform, and share descriptive metadata about arXiv e-prints. Retrieve, store, and use the content of arXiv e-prints for your own personal use, or for research purposes. Provide tools and services to users that helps them to discover or be notified about arXiv e-prints. For example: A better search interface; A mobile app that notifies users about e-prints that might be of interest to them; A visualization of topics in arXiv e-prints over time; A citation graph using bibliographic references from e-prints.

This manual is meant to provide an introduction to using the API, as well as documentation describing its details, and as such is meant to be read by both beginning and advanced users. To get a flavor for how the API works, see the API Quickstart . For more detailed information, see Structure of the API . For examples of using the API from several popular programming languages including perl, python and ruby, see the Examples section. Finally, the Appendices contain an explanation of all input parameters to the API, as well as the output format. 2. API QuickStart The easiest place to start with the API is by accessing it through a web browser. For examples of accessing the API through common programming languages, see the Examples section. Most everyone that has read or submitted e-prints on the arXiv is familiar with the arXiv human web interface. These HTML pages can be accessed by opening up your web browser, and entering the following url in your web browser http://arxiv.org From there, the article listings can be browsed by clicking on one of the many links, or you can search for articles using the search box in the upper right hand side of the page. For example, if I wanted to search for articles that contain the word electron in the title or abstract, I would type electron in the search box, and click Go . If you follow my example, you will see something like this : a web page listing the title and authors of each result, with links to the abstract page, pdf, etc. In its simplest form, the API can be used in exactly the same way. However, it uses a few shortcuts so there is less clicking involved. For example, you can see the same search results for electron by entering the url http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron . Alternatively, you can search for articles that contain electron AND proton with the API by entering http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron+AND+all:proton What you see will look different from the HTML interface, but it contains the same information as the search done with the human interface. The reason why the results look different is that the API returns results in the Atom 1.0 format, and not HTML. Since Atom is defined as an XML grammar, it is much easier to digest for programs than HTML. The API is not intended to be used inside a web browser by itself, but this is a particularly simple way to debug a program that does use the API. You might notice that your web browser has asked you if you want to \u201csubscribe to this feed\u201d after you enter the API url. This is because Atom is one of the formats used by web sites to syndicate their content. These feeds are usually read with feed reader software, and are what is generated by the existing arXiv rss feeds . The current arXiv feeds only give you updates on new papers within the category you specify. One immediately useful thing to do with the API then is to generate your own feed, based on a custom query! To learn more about how to construct custom search queries with the API, see the appendix on the details of query construction . To learn about what information is returned by the API, see the section on the API response . To learn more about writing programs to call the API, and digest the responses, we suggest starting with the section on Structure of the API . 3. Structure of the API In this section, we'll go over some of the details of interacting with the API. A diagram of a typical API call is shown below: Example: A typical API call Request from url: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query (1) with parameters: search_query=all:electron . . . API server processes the request and sends the response . . . Response received by client. (2) The request can be made via HTTP GET, in which the parameters are encoded in the url, or via an HTTP POST in which the parameters are encoded in the HTTP request header. Most client libraries support both methods. If all goes well, the HTTP header will show a 200 OK status, and the response body will contain the Atom response content as shown in the example response . 3.1. Calling the API As mentioned above, the API can be called with an HTTP request of type GET or POST. For our purposes, the main difference is that the parameters are included in the url for a GET request, but not for the POST request. Thus if the parameters list is unusually long, a POST request might be preferred. The parameters for each of the API methods are explained below. For each method, the base url is http://export.arxiv.org/api/{method_name}?{parameters} 3.1.1. Query Interface The API query interface has method_name=query . The table below outlines the parameters that can be passed to the query interface. Parameters are separated with the & sign in the constructed url's. query parameters type defaults required search_query string None No id_list comma-delimited string None No start int 0 No max_results int 10 No 3.1.1.1. search_query and id_list logic We have already seen the use of search_query in the quickstart section. The search_query takes a string that represents a search query used to find articles. The construction of search_query is described in the search query construction appendix . The id_list contains a comma-delimited list of arXiv id's. The logic of these two parameters is as follows: If only search_query is given ( id_list is blank or not given), then the API will return results for each article that matches the search query. If only id_list is given ( search_query is blank or not given), then the API will return results for each article in id_list . If BOTH search_query and id_list are given, then the API will return each article in id_list that matches search_query . This allows the API to act as a results filter. This is summarized in the following table: search_query present id_list present API returns yes no articles that match search_query no yes articles that are in id_list yes yes articles in id_list that also match search_query 3.1.1.2. start and max_results paging Many times there are hundreds of results for an API query. Rather than download information about all the results at once, the API offers a paging mechanism through start and max_results that allows you to download chucks of the result set at a time. Within the total results set, start defines the index of the first returned result, using 0-based indexing . max_results is the number of results returned by the query. For example, if wanted to step through the results of a search_query of all:electron , we would construct the urls: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=0&max_results=10 (1) http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=10&max_results=10 (2) http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=20&max_results=10 (3) Get results 0-9 Get results 10-19 Get results 20-29 Detailed examples of how to perform paging in a variety of programming languages can be found in the examples section. In cases where the API needs to be called multiple times in a row, we encourage you to play nice and incorporate a 3 second delay in your code. The detailed examples below illustrate how to do this in a variety of languages. Because of speed limitations in our implementation of the API, the maximum number of results returned from a single call ( max_results ) is limited to 30000 in slices of at most 2000 at a time, using the max_results and start query parameters. For example to retrieve matches 6001-8000: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=6000&max_results=8000 Large result sets put considerable load on the server and also take a long time to render. We recommend to refine queries which return more than 1,000 results, or at least request smaller slices. For bulk metadata harvesting or set information, etc., the OAI-PMH interface is more suitable. A request with max_results >30,000 will result in an HTTP 400 error code with appropriate explanation. A request for 30000 results will typically take a little over 2 minutes to return a response of over 15MB. Requests for fewer results are much faster and correspondingly smaller. 3.1.1.3. sort order for return results There are two options for for the result set to the API search, sortBy and sortOrder . sortBy can be \"relevance\", \"lastUpdatedDate\", \"submittedDate\" sortOrder can be either \"ascending\" or \"descending\" A sample query using these new parameters looks like: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=ti:\"electron thermal conductivity\"&sortBy=lastUpdatedDate&sortOrder=ascending 3.2. The API Response Everything returned by the API in the body of the HTTP responses is Atom 1.0, including errors . Atom is a grammar of XML that is popular in the world of content syndication, and is very similar to RSS for this purpose. Typically web sites with dynamic content such as news sites and blogs will publish their content as Atom or RSS feeds. However, Atom is a general format that embodies the concept of a list of items, and thus is well-suited to returning the arXiv search results. 3.3. Outline of an Atom feed In this section we will discuss the contents of the Atom documents returned by the API. To see the full explanation of the Atom 1.0 format, please see the Atom specification . An API response consists of an Atom <feed> element which contains metadata about the API call performed, as well as child <entry> elements which embody the metadata for each of the returned results. Below we explain each of the elements and attributes. We will base our discussion on the sample results feed discussed in the examples section. You may notice that the results from the API are ordered differently that the results given by the HTML arXiv search interface . The HTML interface automatically sorts results in descending order based on the date of their submission, while the API returns results according to relevancy from the internal search engine. Thus when debugging a search query, we encourage you to use the API within a web browser, rather than the HTML search interface. If you want sorting by date, you can always do this within your programs by reading the <published> tag for each entry as explained below . 3.3.1. Feed Metadata Every response will contain the line: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> to signify that we are receiving XML 1.0 with a UTF-8 encoding. Following that line will be a line indicating that we are receiving an Atom feed: <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\" xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> You will notice that three XML namespaces are defined. The default namespace signifies that we are dealing with Atom 1.0. The other two namespaces define extensions to Atom that we describe below. 3.3.1.1. <title>, <id>, <link> and <updated> The <title> element gives the title for the feed: <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> ArXiv Query: search_query=all:electron&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1 </title> The title contains a canonicalized version of the query used to call the API. The canonicalization includes all parameters, using their defaults if they were not included, and always puts them in the order search_query , id_list , start , max_results , even if they were specified in a different order in the actual query. The <id> element serves as a unique id for this query, and is useful if you are writing a program such as a feed reader that wants to keep track of all the feeds requested in the past. This id can then be used as a key in a database. <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> http://arxiv.org/api/cHxbiOdZaP56ODnBPIenZhzg5f8 </id> The id is guaranteed to be unique for each query. The <link> element provides a URL that can be used to retrieve this feed again. <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/> Note that the url in the link represents the canonicalized version of the query. The <link> provides a GET requestable url, even if the original request was done via POST. The <updated> element provides the last time the contents of the feed were last updated: <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2007-10-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated> Because the arXiv submission process works on a 24 hour submission cycle, new articles are only available to the API on the midnight after the articles were processed. The <updated> tag thus reflects the midnight of the day that you are calling the API. This is very important - search results do not change until new articles are added. Therefore there is no need to call the API more than once in a day for the same query. Please cache your results. This primarily applies to production systems, and of course you are free to play around with the API while you are developing your program! 3.3.1.2. OpenSearch Extension Elements There are several extension elements defined in the OpenSearch namespace http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/ OpenSearch is a lightweight technology that acts in a similar way as the Web Services Description Language. The OpenSearch elements we have included allow OpenSearch enabled clients to digest our results. Such clients often include search result aggregators and browser pluggins that allow searching from a variety of sources. The OpenSearch extension elements can still be useful to you even if you are not writing one of these applications. The <opensearch:totalResults> element lists how many results are in the result set for the query: <opensearch:totalResults xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\"> 1000 </opensearch:totalResults> This can be very useful when implementing paging of search results . The other two elements <opensearch:startIndex> , and <opensearch:itemsPerPage> are analogous to start , and max_results discussed above . <opensearch:startIndex xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\"> 0 </opensearch:startIndex> <opensearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\"> 1 </opensearch:itemsPerPage> 3.3.2. Entry Metadata If there are no errors, the <feed> element contains 0 or more child <entry> elements with each <entry> representing an article in the returned results set. As explained in the errors section, if there are errors, a single <entry> element representing the error is returned. Below the element description describes the elements for <entry> 's representing arXiv articles. For a general discussion of arXiv metadata, see the arXiv metadata explanation . 3.3.2.1. <title>, <id>, <published>, and <updated> The <title> element contains the title of the article returned: <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> Multi-Electron Production at High Transverse Momenta in ep Collisions at HERA </title> The <id> element contains a url that resolves to the abstract page for that article: <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0307015 </id> If you want only the arXiv id for the article, you can remove the leading http://arxiv.org/abs/ in the <id> . The <published> tag contains the date in which the first version of this article was submitted and processed. The <updated> element contains the date on which the retrieved article was submitted and processed. If the version is version 1, then <published> == <updated> , otherwise they are different. In the example below, the article retrieved was version 2, so <updated> and <published> are different (see the original query ). <published xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> 2007-02-27T16:02:02-05:00 </published> <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> 2007-06-25T17:09:59-04:00 </updated> 3.3.2.2. <summary>, <author> and <category> The <summary> element contains the abstract for the article: <summary xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> Multi-electron production is studied at high electron transverse momentum in positron- and electron-proton collisions using the H1 detector at HERA. The data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 115 pb-1. Di-electron and tri-electron event yields are measured. Cross sections are derived in a restricted phase space region dominated by photon-photon collisions. In general good agreement is found with the Standard Model predictions. However, for electron pair invariant masses above 100 GeV, three di-electron events and three tri-electron events are observed, compared to Standard Model expectations of 0.30 \\pm 0.04 and 0.23 \\pm 0.04, respectively. </summary> There is one <author> element for each author of the paper in order of authorship. Each <author> element has a <name> sub-element which contains the name of the author. <author xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <name xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">H1 Collaboration</name> </author> If author affiliation is present, it is included as an <arxiv:affiliation> subelement of the <author> element as discussed below . The <category> element is used to describe either an arXiv, ACM, or MSC classification. See the arXiv metadata explanation for more details about these classifications. The <category> element has two attributes, scheme , which is the categorization scheme, and term which is the term used in the categorization. Here is an example from the query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=cs/9901002v1 <category xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" term=\"cs.LG\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/> <category xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/> <category xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" term=\"I.2.6\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/> Note that in this example, there are 3 category elements, one for each category. The first two correspond to arXiv categories, and the last one to an ACM category. See <arxiv> extension elements below for information on how to identify the arXiv primary category. 3.3.2.3. <link>'s For each entry, there are up to three <link> elements, distinguished by their rel and title attributes. The table below summarizes what these links refer to rel title refers to always present alternate - abstract page yes related pdf pdf yes related doi resolved doi no For example: <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0307015v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/> <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0307015v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/> <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" title=\"doi\" href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.047340\" rel=\"related\"/> 3.3.2.4. <arxiv> extension elements There are several pieces of arXiv metadata that are not able to be mapped onto the standard Atom specification. We have therefore defined several extension elements which live in the arxiv namespace http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom The arXiv classification system supports multiple <category> tags, as well as a primary classification. The primary classification is a replica of an Atom <category> tag, except it has the name <arxiv:primary_category> . For example, from the query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=cs/9901002v1 , we have <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.LG\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/> signifying that cs.LG is the primary arXiv classification for this e-print. The <arxiv:comment> element contains the typical author comments found on most arXiv articles: <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> 23 pages, 8 figures and 4 tables </arxiv:comment> If the author has supplied affiliation information, then this is included as an <arxiv:affiliation> subelement of the standard Atom <author> element. For example, from the query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=0710.5765v1 , we have <author> <name>G. G. Kacprzak</name> <arxiv:affiliation xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">NMSU</arxiv:affiliation> </author> If the author has provided a journal reference for the article, then there will be a <arxiv:journal_ref> element with this information: <arxiv:journal_ref xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> Eur.Phys.J. C31 (2003) 17-29 </arxiv:journal_ref> If the author has provided a DOI for the article, then there will be a <arxiv:doi> element with this information: <arxiv:doi xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> 10.1529/biophysj.104.047340 </arxiv:doi> 3.4. Errors Errors are returned as Atom feeds with a single entry representing the error. The <summary> for the error contains a helpful error message, and the <link> element contains a url to a more detailed explanation of the message. For example, the API call http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=1234.12345 contains a malformed id, and results in the error <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\"> <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=&amp;id_list=1234.12345\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/> <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">ArXiv Query: search_query=&amp;id_list=1234.12345</title> <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">http://arxiv.org/api/kvuntZ8c9a4Eq5CF7KY03nMug+Q</id> <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2007-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated> <opensearch:totalResults xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1</opensearch:totalResults> <opensearch:startIndex xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">0</opensearch:startIndex> <opensearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1</opensearch:itemsPerPage> <entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">http://arxiv.org/api/errors#incorrect_id_format_for_1234.12345</id> <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">Error</title> <summary xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">incorrect id format for 1234.12345</summary> <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2007-10-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated> <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/api/errors#incorrect_id_format_for_1234.12345\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/> <author xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> <name xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">arXiv api core</name> </author> </entry> </feed> The following table gives information on errors that might occur.

Examples Once you have familiarized yourself with the API, you should be able to easily write programs that call the API automatically. Most programming languages, if not all, have libraries that allow you to make HTTP requests. Since Atom is growing, not all languages have libraries that support Atom parsing, so most of the programming effort will be in digesting the responses you receive. The languages that we know of that can easily handle calling the api via HTTP and parsing the results include: Perl (via LWP ) ( example ) Python (via urllib ) ( example ) Ruby (via uri and net/http ) ( example ) PHP (via file_get_contents()) ( example ) 4.1. Simple Examples Below we include code snippets for these languages that perform the bare minimum functionality - calling the api and printing the raw Atom results. If your favorite language is not up here, write us with an example, and we'll be glad to post it! All of the simple examples produce an output which looks like: Example: A Typical Atom Response <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\" xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> <link xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/> <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">ArXiv Query: search_query=all:electron&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1</title> <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">http://arxiv.org/api/cHxbiOdZaP56ODnBPIenZhzg5f8</id> <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2007-10-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated> <opensearch:totalResults xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1000</opensearch:totalResults> <opensearch:startIndex xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">0</opensearch:startIndex> <opensearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1</opensearch:itemsPerPage> <entry xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"> <id xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0307015</id> <published xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2003-07-07T13:46:39-04:00</published> <updated xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">2003-07-07T13:46:39-04:00</updated> <title xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">Multi-Electron Production at High Transverse Momenta in ep Collisions at HERA</title> <summary xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\"> Multi-electron production is studied at high electron transverse momentum in positron- and electron-proton collisions using the H1 detector at HERA.

Details of Query Construction As outlined in the Structure of the API section, the interface to the API is quite simple. This simplicity, combined with search_query construction, and result set filtering through id_list makes the API a powerful tool for harvesting data from the arXiv. In this section, we outline the possibilities for constructing search_query 's to retrieve our desired article lists. We outlined how to use the id_list parameter to filter results sets in search_query and id_list logic . In the arXiv search engine, each article is divided up into a number of fields that can individually be searched. For example, the titles of an article can be searched, as well as the author list, abstracts, comments and journal reference. To search one of these fields, we simply prepend the field prefix followed by a colon to our search term. For example, suppose we wanted to find all articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro . We could construct the following query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro This returns nine results. The following table lists the field prefixes for all the fields that can be searched. prefix explanation ti Title au Author abs Abstract co Comment jr Journal Reference cat Subject Category rn Report Number id Id (use id_list instead) all All of the above Note: The id_list parameter should be used rather than search_query=id:xxx to properly handle article versions. In addition, note that all: searches in each of the fields simultaneously. The API allows advanced query construction by combining these search fields with Boolean operators. For example, suppose we want to find all articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro that also contain the word checkerboard in the title. We could construct the following query, using the AND operator: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+AND+ti:checkerboard As expected, this query picked out the one of the nine previous results with checkerboard in the title. Note that we included + signs in the urls to the API. In a url, a + sign encodes a space, which is useful since spaces are not allowed in url's. It is always a good idea to escape the characters in your url's, which is a common feature in most programming libraries that deal with url's. Note that the <title> of the returned feed has spaces in the query constructed. It is a good idea to look at <title> to see if you have escaped your url correctly. The following table lists the three possible Boolean operators. AND OR ANDNOT The ANDNOT Boolean operator is particularly useful, as it allows us to filter search results based on certain fields. For example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that did not contain the word checkerboard , we could construct the following query: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+ANDNOT+ti:checkerboard As expected, this query returns eight results. Finally, even more complex queries can be used by using parentheses for grouping the Boolean expressions. To include parentheses in in a url, use %28 for a left-parens ( , and %29 for a right-parens ) . For example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that did not contain the words checkerboard , OR Pyrochore , we could construct the following query: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+ANDNOT+%28ti:checkerboard+OR+ti:Pyrochlore%29 This query returns three results. Notice that the <title> element displays the parenthesis correctly meaning that we used the correct url escaping. So far we have only used single words as the field terms to search for. You can include entire phrases by enclosing the phrase in double quotes, escaped by %22 . For example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that contain quantum criticality , we could construct the following query: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+AND+ti:%22quantum+criticality%22 This query returns one result, and notice that the feed <title> contains double quotes as expected. The table below lists the two grouping operators used in the API. symbol encoding explanation ( ) %28 %29 Used to group Boolean expressions for Boolean operator precedence. double quotes %22 %22 Used to group multiple words into phrases to search a particular field. space + Used to extend a search_query to include multiple fields. 5.1.1. A Note on Article Versions Each arXiv article has a version associated with it. The first time an article is posted, it is given a version number of 1. When subsequent corrections are made to an article, it is resubmitted, and the version number is incremented. At any time, any version of an article may be retrieved. When using the API, if you want to retrieve the latest version of an article, you may simply enter the arxiv id in the id_list parameter. If you want to retrieve information about a specific version, you can do this by appending vn to the id, where n is the version number you are interested in. For example, to retrieve the latest version of cond-mat/0207270 , you could use the query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=cond-mat/0207270 . To retrieve the very first version of this article, you could use the query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=cond-mat/0207270v1 5.2.

Preface"},{"location":"help/api/user-manual.html#2-api-quickstart","text":"The easiest place to start with the API is by accessing it through a web browser. For examples of accessing the API through common programming languages, see the Examples section. Most everyone that has read or submitted e-prints on the arXiv is familiar with the arXiv human web interface. These HTML pages can be accessed by opening up your web browser, and entering the following url in your web browser http://arxiv.org From there, the article listings can be browsed by clicking on one of the many links, or you can search for articles using the search box in the upper right hand side of the page. For example, if I wanted to search for articles that contain the word electron in the title or abstract, I would type electron in the search box, and click Go . If you follow my example, you will see something like this : a web page listing the title and authors of each result, with links to the abstract page, pdf, etc. In its simplest form, the API can be used in exactly the same way. However, it uses a few shortcuts so there is less clicking involved. For example, you can see the same search results for electron by entering the url http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron . Alternatively, you can search for articles that contain electron AND proton with the API by entering http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron+AND+all:proton What you see will look different from the HTML interface, but it contains the same information as the search done with the human interface. The reason why the results look different is that the API returns results in the Atom 1.0 format, and not HTML. Since Atom is defined as an XML grammar, it is much easier to digest for programs than HTML. The API is not intended to be used inside a web browser by itself, but this is a particularly simple way to debug a program that does use the API. You might notice that your web browser has asked you if you want to \u201csubscribe to this feed\u201d after you enter the API url. This is because Atom is one of the formats used by web sites to syndicate their content. These feeds are usually read with feed reader software, and are what is generated by the existing arXiv rss feeds . The current arXiv feeds only give you updates on new papers within the category you specify. One immediately useful thing to do with the API then is to generate your own feed, based on a custom query! To learn more about how to construct custom search queries with the API, see the appendix on the details of query construction . To learn about what information is returned by the API, see the section on the API response . To learn more about writing programs to call the API, and digest the responses, we suggest starting with the section on Structure of the API .","title":"2.

The id_list contains a comma-delimited list of arXiv id's. The logic of these two parameters is as follows: If only search_query is given ( id_list is blank or not given), then the API will return results for each article that matches the search query. If only id_list is given ( search_query is blank or not given), then the API will return results for each article in id_list . If BOTH search_query and id_list are given, then the API will return each article in id_list that matches search_query . This allows the API to act as a results filter.

Rather than download information about all the results at once, the API offers a paging mechanism through start and max_results that allows you to download chucks of the result set at a time. Within the total results set, start defines the index of the first returned result, using 0-based indexing . max_results is the number of results returned by the query. For example, if wanted to step through the results of a search_query of all:electron , we would construct the urls: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=0&max_results=10 (1) http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=10&max_results=10 (2) http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=20&max_results=10 (3) Get results 0-9 Get results 10-19 Get results 20-29 Detailed examples of how to perform paging in a variety of programming languages can be found in the examples section. In cases where the API needs to be called multiple times in a row, we encourage you to play nice and incorporate a 3 second delay in your code. The detailed examples below illustrate how to do this in a variety of languages. Because of speed limitations in our implementation of the API, the maximum number of results returned from a single call ( max_results ) is limited to 30000 in slices of at most 2000 at a time, using the max_results and start query parameters. For example to retrieve matches 6001-8000: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:electron&start=6000&max_results=8000 Large result sets put considerable load on the server and also take a long time to render. We recommend to refine queries which return more than 1,000 results, or at least request smaller slices. For bulk metadata harvesting or set information, etc., the OAI-PMH interface is more suitable. A request with max_results >30,000 will result in an HTTP 400 error code with appropriate explanation. A request for 30000 results will typically take a little over 2 minutes to return a response of over 15MB. Requests for fewer results are much faster and correspondingly smaller.","title":"3.1.1.2. start and max_results paging"},{"location":"help/api/user-manual.html#3113-sort-order-for-return-results","text":"There are two options for for the result set to the API search, sortBy and sortOrder . sortBy can be \"relevance\", \"lastUpdatedDate\", \"submittedDate\" sortOrder can be either \"ascending\" or \"descending\" A sample query using these new parameters looks like: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=ti:\"electron thermal conductivity\"&sortBy=lastUpdatedDate&sortOrder=ascending","title":"3.1.1.3. sort order for return results"},{"location":"help/api/user-manual.html#32-the-api-response","text":"Everything returned by the API in the body of the HTTP responses is Atom 1.0, including errors .

Appendices"},{"location":"help/api/user-manual.html#51-details-of-query-construction","text":"As outlined in the Structure of the API section, the interface to the API is quite simple. This simplicity, combined with search_query construction, and result set filtering through id_list makes the API a powerful tool for harvesting data from the arXiv. In this section, we outline the possibilities for constructing search_query 's to retrieve our desired article lists. We outlined how to use the id_list parameter to filter results sets in search_query and id_list logic . In the arXiv search engine, each article is divided up into a number of fields that can individually be searched. For example, the titles of an article can be searched, as well as the author list, abstracts, comments and journal reference. To search one of these fields, we simply prepend the field prefix followed by a colon to our search term. For example, suppose we wanted to find all articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro . We could construct the following query http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro This returns nine results. The following table lists the field prefixes for all the fields that can be searched. prefix explanation ti Title au Author abs Abstract co Comment jr Journal Reference cat Subject Category rn Report Number id Id (use id_list instead) all All of the above Note: The id_list parameter should be used rather than search_query=id:xxx to properly handle article versions. In addition, note that all: searches in each of the fields simultaneously. The API allows advanced query construction by combining these search fields with Boolean operators. For example, suppose we want to find all articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro that also contain the word checkerboard in the title. We could construct the following query, using the AND operator: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+AND+ti:checkerboard As expected, this query picked out the one of the nine previous results with checkerboard in the title. Note that we included + signs in the urls to the API. In a url, a + sign encodes a space, which is useful since spaces are not allowed in url's. It is always a good idea to escape the characters in your url's, which is a common feature in most programming libraries that deal with url's. Note that the <title> of the returned feed has spaces in the query constructed. It is a good idea to look at <title> to see if you have escaped your url correctly. The following table lists the three possible Boolean operators. AND OR ANDNOT The ANDNOT Boolean operator is particularly useful, as it allows us to filter search results based on certain fields. For example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that did not contain the word checkerboard , we could construct the following query: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+ANDNOT+ti:checkerboard As expected, this query returns eight results. Finally, even more complex queries can be used by using parentheses for grouping the Boolean expressions. To include parentheses in in a url, use %28 for a left-parens ( , and %29 for a right-parens ) . For example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that did not contain the words checkerboard , OR Pyrochore , we could construct the following query: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+ANDNOT+%28ti:checkerboard+OR+ti:Pyrochlore%29 This query returns three results. Notice that the <title> element displays the parenthesis correctly meaning that we used the correct url escaping. So far we have only used single words as the field terms to search for. You can include entire phrases by enclosing the phrase in double quotes, escaped by %22 . For example, if we wanted all of the articles by the author Adrian DelMaestro with titles that contain quantum criticality , we could construct the following query: http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=au:del_maestro+AND+ti:%22quantum+criticality%22 This query returns one result, and notice that the feed <title> contains double quotes as expected. The table below lists the two grouping operators used in the API. symbol encoding explanation ( ) %28 %29 Used to group Boolean expressions for Boolean operator precedence. double quotes %22 %22 Used to group multiple words into phrases to search a particular field. space + Used to extend a search_query to include multiple fields.","title":"5.1.

The basic procedures will often yield superior results with considerably less effort. The first stage in advanced bitmapping of PostScript is to use Ghostscript to create a portable bitmap (pbm) file from the original inefficient PostScript. Then the pbm file can be converted into GIF, JPEG, or back into PostScript. With luck one of these formats will be more compact. Do not submit the pbm, pgm or ppm files themselves, as these are inefficient formats. You must convert all pbm, pgm and ppm files to GIF, JPEG, or PostScript before submitting them. Using Ghostscript to Create Bitmapped Figures The first step is to create a portable bitmap using Ghostscript. To create a pbm file from a PostScript file, try a command like this, cat fig.ps | gs -q -sDEVICE=pbmraw -sOutputFile=- -r75 - > fig.pbm The resolution of the bitmap in dots-per-inch is given by the \" -r \" option; 75dpi is a good choice. For an encapsulated PostScript (eps) file, it may be necessary to add a showpage command to the end of the eps file (or the output file will be empty). One way would be something like this, (cat fig.eps ; echo showpage ) | gs -q -sDEVICE=pbmraw -sOutputFile=- -r75 - > fig.pbm To make greyscale or color bitmaps instead, choose \" -sDEVICE=pgmraw \" (greymap) or \" -sDEVICE=ppmraw \" (color pixmap), respectively. Now you should have a pbm file of your figure. You must convert it to GIF, JPEG or PostScript before submitting it. You can either load it into XV to save it in one of these formats, or use the PBM tools to do the same. Converting a .pgm or .ppm Bitmap File to GIF or JPEG With XV this is straightforward -- just load in the image and save it as the appropriate type. With PBM , use the ppmtogif command to make gifs, ppmtogif fig.pbm > fig.gif PBM does not include a tool for making JPEG files. You need the cjpeg utility (mentioned below), and a command like this: cjpeg fig.ppm > fig.jpeg Note that only color .ppm or greyscale .pgm images can be converted to jpegs using cjpeg (if Ghostscript finds only black and white in the image, then it will output a simpler .pbm file). Converting a .pbm Bitmap File to PostScript In most cases you will want to get the figure back into PostScript format. You can use the XV \"Save as PostScript\" option, or you can use the pnmtops utility in the PBM toolset. If you are using PBM, the command is: pnmcrop fig.pbm | pnmtops -noturn -rle > fig.new.ps The pnmcrop utility trims the margins down to the right size (you can get the same effect by clicking the \"Autocrop\" button in XV), the \" -noturn \" option keeps the image in the same orientation (otherwise it would be rotated to fit the page better under certain circumstances), and the \" -rle \" option does run length encoding, making the uncompressed image more efficient, so you should definitely use it . We do not want PostScript bitmaps generated without this option because they can be many megabytes in size when unzipped. We have found that the pnmtops command supplied with the PBM tools does not do a particularly good job. It drops pixels and down-samples the image, giving quite a bad result. We made a modified version, called pnmtops2 , which we use here and usually looks better. It is included in our autoconf version of pbm mentioned below. Take a look at the new PostScript file with Ghostscript and print it out (the printout generally looks much better than the on-screen version). Hopefully the quality will be acceptable. If not, go back and try bitmapping with a higher resolution. Once the figure is acceptable, gzip both the original and new PostScript files and check the saving.

What are the best formats for image types? What about other formats? What is a reasonable size for figures? Almost all figures can easily be reduced to less than 50kB each (gzipped) without significant loss of quality, by using an appropriate format. If you cannot make your figure files smaller than this, you are probably doing something wrong (e.g. using an inappropriate format, or unnecessarily high resolution). All the figures we have encountered can be compressed to less than 50kB without significant loss of quality. Prioritize the figures for optimization by looking at the gzipped sizes, and deal with the largest ones first. What are the best formats for image types? Most of the inefficient PostScript figures submitted to arXiv are one of three types: Photographic images (e.g., astronomical images): 3D plots, color contour plots, and screen shots: Line drawings, diagrams, and PostScript output from data plotting programs with millions of points (e.g., graphs from Mathematica, Supermongo, paw, 3d surface plots, etc.). These are all candidates for resaving as compressed bitmapped PostScript that can be included in the paper (if the resulting file is of a reasonably small size). The JPEG format is specially designed for photographic images with many colors, such as astronomical images, plates, etc. The GIF and PNG formats can be used for images with sharp edges or fine detail -- they provide lossless compression, and work well with color, greyscale, and black & white images. Note that JPEG and GIF can be directly wrapped into level 2 PostScript while preserving the compression see ImageMagick , imgtops , and jpeg2ps for more details. What about other formats? You should only submit images as JPEG, PNG, GIF or PostScript. We do not accept other formats, such as pbm, pgm, ppm, xbm, bmp, xwd, pcx, etc. because they are either inefficient or viewers are not available for all platforms. If you have a figure in one of these formats you should convert it to JPEG, PNG, GIF or PostScript before submitting it.","title":"Faq"},{"location":"help/bitmap/faq.html#frequently-asked-questions","text":"What is a reasonable size for figures?

If the new figure has a gzipped size greater than that of the old figure, then there are several things you can try. Try reducing the resolution of the bitmap. Try reducing the number of colors used. Try switching to greyscale instead of color, or black/white instead of greyscale. Finally remember that bitmapping is not magic It can reduce the size of some figures, but will make others larger. Some skill is required in judging which images will bitmap well. Bitmapping works whenever the original PostScript was so inefficient that it actually takes less space to specify the entire image pixel-by-pixel than using the original form (modulo differences in compression). Obviously the original PostScript has to be very inefficient for this to be the case, but there are plenty of programs which do generate such really inefficient output. The bitmap has strange checkerboard patterns or stripes If the original PostScript itself was a bitmap (e.g. produced by IDL or some other numerical package) don't attempt to bitmap it again.

It depends on your operating system: Most platforms (including Windows): ImageMagick Unix/Linux: XV screen grab Mac: Mac screen capture ImageMagick Image Magick is a suite of very powerful and feature rich image manipulation programs available for many platforms. The ImageMagick homepage is well worth a visit. Frequently the following two conversions give a significant reduction in filesize with very reasonable visual quality: Making a GIF-encoded PostScript: % convert figure.ps figure.gif % convert figure.gif newfigure.ps Making a JPEG-encoded PostScript: % convert figure.ps figure.jpg % convert figure.jpg newfigure.ps You may need to adjust the BoundingBox of the original or use the size option with convert . You can also try some of the many of convert 's options, like monochrome, sharpen, etc. to achieve better visual quality (refer to ImageMagick documentation for more details). Shortcut to getting a bitmap version of any figure using XV If you have XV installed, there is an easy way to make a bitmap version of any figure. First, display the original figure on the screen somehow, e.g. with ghostview. DO NOT open PostScript figures with XV -- this simply uses ghostscript as a backend to generate a low resolution ppmraw bitmap. It is better to display the PostScript file at the desired size with your favorite viewer and then grab the image from screen as described below. Next, use the \"Grab\" button in XV to snatch a copy of the displayed image into XV's buffer (after selecting \"Grab\" you can do this either by clicking the left mouse button on the desired window -- which grabs the whole window, or by holding down the middle mouse button and dragging -- which selects a region). Once the image is in XV's buffer, you can manipulate it. You should use \"Autocrop\" or \"Crop\" to remove any excess margins around the figure. Then save it as a color or greyscale PostScript. Note: When resaving as PostScript, you must click the XV \"compress\" box; this vastly reduces the file size with no loss of quality. The \"compress\" option is available only when XV is in 8bit mode, this is selected from the 24/8 Bit menu in the XV controls window. You almost certainly do not need a 24bit color map so you should use 8bit mode. Also, you should save as Greyscale , Full Color or Reduced Color rather than B/W Dithered which does not allow compression. We do not want PostScript bitmaps generated without this option because they can be many megabytes in size when unzipped. Finally, make sure that the size of the newly saved image is smaller than the original. In addition, the uncompressed size of a figure should not exceed 500kB. Shortcut to getting a bitmap version of any figure using Macintosh The easiest way to create a bitmap off the screen on a Mac is to follow this procedure: Capture the screen: Press command - shift - 3 (That is the \"clover\"-key, the shift-key and the 3-key simultaneously). This saves a pict-file of the entire screen onto your hard drive. Use one of the many shareware/freeware programs to crop the figure and save it in your favorite file format. A free one is Imagery 1.9 Graphics Converter, which is available from any info-mac site . A particularly powerful one is the shareware program Graphic Converter 2.5 from the same site.","title":"Procedure"},{"location":"help/bitmap/procedure.html#what-is-the-easiest-way-to-do-bitmapping","text":"It depends on your operating system: Most platforms (including Windows): ImageMagick Unix/Linux: XV screen grab Mac: Mac screen capture","title":"What is the easiest way to do bitmapping?"},{"location":"help/bitmap/procedure.html#imagemagick","text":"Image Magick is a suite of very powerful and feature rich image manipulation programs available for many platforms.

Also, you should save as Greyscale , Full Color or Reduced Color rather than B/W Dithered which does not allow compression. We do not want PostScript bitmaps generated without this option because they can be many megabytes in size when unzipped. Finally, make sure that the size of the newly saved image is smaller than the original. In addition, the uncompressed size of a figure should not exceed 500kB.","title":"Shortcut to getting a bitmap version of any figure using XV"},{"location":"help/bitmap/procedure.html#shortcut-to-getting-a-bitmap-version-of-any-figure-using-macintosh","text":"The easiest way to create a bitmap off the screen on a Mac is to follow this procedure: Capture the screen: Press command - shift - 3 (That is the \"clover\"-key, the shift-key and the 3-key simultaneously).

Unfortunately, mirror installations require significant maintenance and we are working to reduce the size of our mirror network. Furthermore, network \"closeness\" does not closely match geographical proximity so geographically dispersed mirrors help far fewer users than one might naively imagine. There are other ways, however, to speed up your access. One solution now is to use the Squid Cache in HTTPD Accelerator mode to pre-fetch new papers each night and cache them. When you start out you will get faster access to new papers each day, since they have been pre-fetched. As time passes the store of papers in the cache will grow continuously larger. Eventually you should have a good fraction of the archive available. In principle nothing will be removed from the cache until you have used up all the available disk space, and then the least accessed files will be deleted to make room for new ones. Some of the advantages of the system are: To the user, it looks like a mirror site, it works with any browser and you don't have to configure any PROXY settings. It requires minimal system administration. If you click on a file and then abort the download (e.g. by clicking \"Stop\") Squid will continue downloading the file in the background. If you return to the cache later the file should be available. Squid will run comfortably on old hardware (say 10GB of disk space (more disk space would be better)). Squid is free software The disadvantages are: Old papers won't be available from the cache until someone requests them once. Searching and other interactive pages can't be cached. Setting up Squid as an HTTPD accelerator cache For information on getting Squid see: The Squid homepage Before setting up your cache send us e-mail telling us the hostname of the machine you are using, so that we will recognize it in case of problems. It makes sense to have only one cache in each country or in each network. Please check with other institutions in your country to coordinate this. In particular, if one institution has a fast dedicated internet connection to the US, then the cache should be located there. Here is a suitable squid configuration file, optimized for caching pages and files from arXiv.org: Example Squid configuration file The lines that you need to change are marked **. Here is a suitable script for downloading the new papers each night: Script for daily updates Again, lines you'll need to change are marked **. If you think you need to make other changes to the script it would be a good idea to check with us before using them. Also please let us know if changes are necessary for updates to Squid. You will need GNU wget as part of the script and YOU MUST COMPILE wget WITH THE FOLLOWING PATCH TO AVOID SETTING OFF OUR ROBOT DETECTION SYSTEM : Patch against wget (1.10.2) to use correct user-agent string when checking robots.txt (this patch based on posts to the wget mailing list).

Set up the script to run on each day where there are new papers. The news papers are available at 20:00 EDT/EST each Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

You will need GNU wget as part of the script and YOU MUST COMPILE wget WITH THE FOLLOWING PATCH TO AVOID SETTING OFF OUR ROBOT DETECTION SYSTEM : Patch against wget (1.10.2) to use correct user-agent string when checking robots.txt (this patch based on posts to the wget mailing list). Assuming that you start from some directory with the wget source files and the patch, you should be able to patch and compile with: tmp# ls wget-1.10.2.tar.gz wget_patch.txt tmp# tar -zxf wget-1.10.2.tar.gz wget-1.10.2.tar.gz wget-1.10.2/ tmp# cd wget-1.10.2 tmp/wget-1.10.2# patch -p0 < ../wget_patch.txt patching file src/init.c patching file src/res.c tmp/wget-1.10.2# ./configure; make; make install ... Set up the script to run on each day where there are new papers. The news papers are available at 20:00 EDT/EST each Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

Some latex packages such as the cite package normally show citations in a condensed form using a range, e.g., [1-4], instead of [1,2,3,4]. By default, we process papers with HyperTeX , which automatically adds hyperlinks from the citations with the body of the text to the bibliography. To be able to do this on a per-citation basis it is necessary to use the long form (how would you link to reference 2 in 1-4?), so this is the default behavior.

This mainly affects the margins you choose and the style file options. Solution The easiest way to adjust margins without changing page or line breaks is to use the (La)TeX commands \\voffset and \\hoffset in the document header. For example, for a shift of 0.8 inches upwards use: \\voffset=-0.8in somewhere before \\begin{document} . Moreover, if the style file or documentclass allow for papersize selection, you should always use the letter option for submission to arXiv; e.g., \\documentclass[letterpaper]{article} For a more general solution, see the geometry package .

If you have a wide table or other material that should be printed in landscape mode, you should follow the instructions given in the dvips info pages. For your convenience, we appended the two relevant sections from the dvips documentation. Before you go on , however, be warned that the standard paper size in the US is letter , which is shorter than A4 paper, i.e., less wide in landscape mode, and that your landscape documents need to be tuned to properly fit on letter paper. Otherwise text may be truncated when printed in the US. Note also that there are different conventions as to which way to rotate pages, and this (apart from being upside down on screen) affects the margins. Always check the postscript we generate here and make adjustments as necessary. Paper Size and Landscape Orientation Although most TeX documents at a particular site are designed to use the standard paper size (letter size in the United States, A4 in Europe), the dvips program can be customized , either site-wide or for a particular printer. Many documents are designed for other paper sizes. For instance, you may want to design a document that has the long edge of the paper horizontal. This can be useful when typesetting booklets, brochures, complex tables, or many other documents. This type of paper orientation is called \"landscape\" orientation (the default orientation is \"portrait\"). Alternatively, a document might be designed for ledger or A3 paper. Since the intended paper size is a document design decision, not a printing decision, such information should be given in the TeX file and not on the dvips command line. For this reason, dvips supports a papersize special . It is hoped that this special will become standard over time for TeX previewers and other printer drivers. The Papersize Special The format of the papersize special is: \\special{papersize=WIDTH,HEIGHT} WIDTH is the horizontal size of the page, and HEIGHT is the vertical size. The dimensions supported are the same as for TeX; namely, in (inches), cm (centimeters), mm (millimeters), pt (points), sp (scaled points), bp (big points, the same as the default PostScript unit), pc (picas), dd (didot points), and cc (ciceros). For a US letter size landscape document, the papersize would be: \\special{papersize=11in,8.5in} An alternate specification of landscape: \\special{landscape} is supported for backward compatibility, but it is hoped that eventually the papersize comment will dominate. Of course, such a \\special only informs dvips of the desired paper size; you must also adjust \\hsize and \\vsize in your TeX document typeset to those dimensions. The papersize special must occur somewhere on the first page of the document. How to Pass a Papersize Flag to our Postscript Generator If for some reason the method described above does not work for you, all hope is not lost. You can alternatively pass a landscape flag to our automated postscript generator to be used by dvips. Example Suppose you have TeX source for some wide tables that were prepared to be printed in landscape mode; let's call them mywidetable1.tex and mywidetable2.tex . On your local system, these can be processed with: $ dvips -t landscape mywidetable1.dvi $ dvips -t landscape mywidetable2.dvi On our system, this can be accomplished by including a file with special instructions for our postscript generator in your submission. This file has to be called 00README.XXX \u2014 the filename has to be all uppercase, it starts with two zeros, and it has to be in the top level directory of your submission . In our example, 00README.XXX should contain one line for each table to be processed with the landscape flag: mywidetable1.dvi landscape mywidetable2.dvi landscape Note that the file extensions are .dvi ( not .tex ) because the instruction applies to the dvi to ps stage, not to the tex to dvi stage.","title":"How to Prepare Pages for Landscape Printout"},{"location":"help/faq/landscape.html#how-to-prepare-pages-for-landscape-printout","text":"Note: Because these instructions are exclusive to dvips, they are not applicable to PDFLaTeX submissions, which produce PDF directly and do not follow the LaTeX-->DVI-->PostScript-->PDF conversion path.

Missing number, treated as zero \" error To disable HyperTeX \" Can't write subdir/file.aux \" and other problems with write permissions during TeX processing \" ! Double subscript/superscript \" errors PDF conversion failure in papers with complex section structure arXiv system attempts processing with PDFLaTeX for submissions which are regular latex Why does my submission fail the automatic TeXing procedure when I use Feynmf? Why does my submission fail to recognize the main tex file? Problems with inclusion of binary or other bitmap figures; PS BAD warnings Absolute filenames When including figures/style/class/macro files, you must use relative filenames instead of absolute filenames. For example, myfigure.png is correct, while: /users/staff/fred/myarticle/myfigure.png is not. Absolute filenames make it impossible for anyone to use the source without modifying it. Unless your TeX system happens to have the same directory structure as ours, then our automated processing will fail. Upper-case vs Lower-case filenames If you use a computer with case-insensitive filenames (e.g., Windows), be sure that the case of any filenames referred to in your TeX file matches exactly the files that are uploaded. For example, the command: \\includegraphics{figure1.eps} will not work if the file is uploaded as FIGURE1.EPS because filenames are case-sensitive on our system. Missing style/macro files Some authors write their own style/macro files (or modify standard ones), but forget to include them with the source. Be sure to include with the source any style/macro files that we don't have. Note: non-standard style/macro files provided along with the source must NOT be attached to a paper. Instead, submit them as separate files, or use tar or zip to combine them with the source files before submitting. Last minute untested changes All too often, an author will make last minute changes to the source, but won't test it to see if the results will TeX correctly. You can save yourself a lot of trouble by testing that everything works properly before submitting your paper. User intervention Our source to postscript conversion system (called \"AutoTeX\") is fully automated . There is no genie present to answer questions such as: Would you like (P)ortrait or (L)andscape ? - answer P/L If your source needs to ask these types of question, please create a file called filename.inp (where filename matches the file it is to act on) that contains suitable responses. Your .inp file can be first tested on your local machine by running the following command: $ cat filename.inp | tex filename.tex Multiple files concatenated Do not submit several files all concatenated into one file, such as the Scientific Workplace's .rap file type -- such files cannot be separated automatically and may fail to process in unexpected ways. Instead, please create a .tar.gz or .zip file. Use of old or non-standard style files Style files change with time, and you (or we) might be using old versions of style files. We try to keep up to date, so if problems arise due to style files, please check that the version you are using is current. Some well-known style files, e.g., epsf.sty and epsfig.sty , have been altered by TeX programmers, then uploaded to web sites under the same filename. This is very bad practice and anti-social behavior, since we end up with multiple versions of standard styles. arXiv will make every effort to support the most recent and official versions of standard style files. As an example, the graphics and graphicx packages have been standard since the release of LaTeX 2e and are the recommended graphics inclusion macros. These packages provide the most portable and reliable method of including graphics. Style files incompatible with dvips Style files that are incompatible with dvips , e.g., epsbox.sty , can cause problems. If the DVI requires exotic versions of dvips (e.g., jdvi2kps ) to produce postscript, then our automated system will fail . Please make every effort to avoid using non-standard styles and dvi2ps utilities. Few people will be able to process papers in these non-standard formats. Sources that rely on something other than TeX or LaTeX All papers should be formatted so they work with TeX or LaTeX (as appropriate). If you use other formats (as opposed to style files or macros), e.g., AMS-TeX , AMS-LaTeX , or aatex , then please add the appropriate line to the top of the source, e.g.: %&amslplain for AMS-LaTeX (based on amslatex version 1.1), \\input amstex or %&amstex for AMS-TeX , and \\input cp-aa.tex or %&cp-aa for Springer-Verlag's Plain TeX Astronomy & Astrophysics macros, cp-aa (also known as aatex ). Anything that relies on something other than TeX or (PDF)LaTeX will fail. At this time arXiv does not support processing with: XeTeX and its variants including LuaTeX, LyX, or PDFTeX. Use of unusual/uncommon fonts Authors should keep in mind that if they use unusual fonts, many potential readers of their work won't have them installed. Because it would require significant admin time to install and maintain non-standard fonts, we do not generally support such fonts. It is, however, possible to include your local metafont .mf files as well as your local fontmap.map file. This will require special handling with a 00README.XXX file with the appropriate fontmap directive. Unprotected \\cite and other macros inside figure \\caption commands, \" line too long \" error In LaTeX, any citations inside a figure \\caption should be protected using the \\protect command; e.g., \\caption{Electron spectral function from \\protect\\cite{spectral}} . This delays the expansion of the citation until the second latex pass, i.e., when the reference has been defined. Marking files to be ignored If you need to include files in the source that should not be processed by the automated system, you may do either of the following: Add an %auto-ignore near the top of the file. This directive can be anywhere in the first 10 lines of the file, and anywhere on the line. It should appear before any TeX or LaTeX commands, since otherwise they would be recognized first. For example: %auto-ignore This is a README file for paper hep-ex/9901003 More data for our experiment is available at http://www.some.where/else Include a file 00README.XXX with your submission that includes the line: filename ignore for each file that should be ignored. \" ! Missing number, treated as zero \" error If you use epsf to include PostScript figures you must make sure that the %%BoundingBox definitions are near the start of the PostScript figure files. In order to reduce processing time, our TeX system does not scan the whole of each included file. If you have a file with the following structure: %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ... ... %%BoundingBox: (atend) ... [ bulk of PS file in here ] ... %%BoundingBox: 0 10 234 456 ... %%EOF then simply move the %%BoundingBox line to the top: %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ... ... %%BoundingBox: 0 10 234 456 ... [ bulk of PS file in here ] ... %%EOF To disable HyperTeX By default, our TeX system uses HyperTeX to add hyperlinks between references, sections and equations within your paper. These show up in the PDF (and in the PostScript with some viewers). HyperTeX conflicts with a few style and class files. If you think this is a problem, you can disable HyperTeX for your submission by including a file 00README.XXX . It should contain the line: nohypertex Note that HyperTeX changes the way citations appear in some styles -- ranges will be represented as [11, 12, 13] instead of [11-13]. This is necessary for HyperTeX to be able to make individual links to each citation. Unless you feel very strongly about this we recommend leaving HyperTeX on. \" Can't write subdir/file.aux \" and other problems with write permissions during TeX processing In our system, only the top level directory is granted write permission during processing. Attempts to write files to subdirectories will fail. All files included via \\include instead of \\input must be in the top level directory. This is because the \\include command attempts to write a separate .aux file in the same directory as the included file. For example: \\input{file} %OK, does not create separate .aux file \\input{subdir/file} %OK, does not create separate .aux file \\include{file} %OK because file.aux can be written \\include{subdir/file} %WILL FAIL fail because sub/file.aux cannot be written \" ! Double subscript/superscript \" errors Our TeX system complains about double subscripts (and superscripts) because a_x_y could be read as a_{x_y} or {a_x}_y or a_x{}_y or even a_{xy} . These are not the same since the character size and position is affected. Some older TeX systems would automatically substitute a_x{}_y without the need for user intervention, but current TeX systems (including ours) will not do this. As a result, the appropriate interpretation must be explicitly specified . If you are curious about the differences, see these examples . PDF conversion failure in papers with complex section structure In some papers with \"elaborate\" section structure, hyperref can generate PostScript that contains bad pdfmarks which break PDF conversion. This problem affects mostly longer papers, reviews, theses, etc., i.e. those papers where a linked table of contents (TOC) and document outline would be most useful! The reason is that the section counter (used for the names of destination links) is reset by authors and certain macros to control the numbering of appendix sections. The result is failure of ps2pdf conversion due to ambiguous pdfmarks or conflicting subsection count in the pdfmarks. The simple cure is to disable HyperTex but a better work-around is to simply switch off bookmarks (i.e. document outline) while leaving normal document linking on. You can do this by adding the following line to the preamble: ``` \\usepackage[bookmarks=false]{hyperref} ``` arXiv system attempts processing with PDFLaTeX for submissions which are regular latex A common mistake made by authors as well as many macro packages is incorrect testing for \\pdfoutput to decide whether pdflatex is run in dvi mode or pdf mode, or whether the processing is done in regular latex mode. The underlying engines used to be different and a simple test for \\ifx\\pdfoutput\\undefined was sufficient to distinguish between all options. This is no longer the case, because the underlying engine is the same for all 3 cases and therefore the value of the \\pdfoutput parameter has to be tested, too. That is, a common (but incorrect) testing sequence might look like: \"\\ifx\\pdfoutput\\undefined .... \\else ..... \\fi\". Symptoms of this mistake might be: error messages \"Option clash for package ....\" some unexpected message about various pdf operators failing figure inclusions (due to unrecognized extension) The most reliable way to accomplish conditional branching in the TeX source where necessary is instead via the ifpdf package: \\usepackage{ifpdf} \\ifpdf do something pdflatex specific here \\else do something for regular latex or pdflatex in dvi mode \\fi Note that the graphics package and the hyperref package are smart enough to figure this out on their own. You do not need to specify any driver for these packages.

Why does arXiv's system fail to recognize the main tex file? It is possible in writing your latex code to include your \\documentclass directive in a file other than the main .tex file. While this is perfectly reasonable for a human who's compling to know which of the tex files is the main one (even when using something obvious as the filename, such as ms.tex ), our AutoTeX system will attempt to process whichever file has the \\documentclass directive as the main tex file. Note that the system does not process using Makefile or any other manifest-type files. Problems with inclusion of binary or other bitmap figures; PS BAD warnings Update 2011-12-06: arXiv's default dvips configuration was changed to retain comments. The following does not apply to papers received since then. By default, our TeX system tells dvips to strip comment lines from included PostScript figures. This is usually the correct thing to do because it prevents DSC (Document Structuring Comments) lines from being included from figures. If included, these would likely break the DSC structure of the final PostScript (the DSC structure is what allows viewers to display an index of page numbers). Lines starting with ' % ' in the included PostScript files are identified as comments, but sometimes PostScript figures include blocks of data with lines starting with ' % ' that are not comments. Removal of these lines may break the final PostScript. You can turn off the removal of comments from included figures for your submission by including a file 00README.XXX . It should contain an instruction specific to the filename of the dvi file: filename.dvi keepcomments You can test the effect of this yourself by comparing the output of $ dvips -R -K1 yourfile.dvi -o DSCstripped.ps $ dvips -R -K0 yourfile.dvi -o DSCkept.ps Note that this whole issue arises because Adobe decided to use the ignored \"Comments\" from the PostScript standard to provide additional structure to regular PostScript files, which leads to complications for programs that rely on proper DSC structure when two or more such files are included in each other.","title":"Common Mistakes that cause Automated Processing to Fail"},{"location":"help/faq/mistakes.html#common-mistakes-that-cause-automated-processing-to-fail","text":"NEWS 2017-02-09: We have upgraded our TeX system to TeXLive 2016 and revised the macro package tree for new submissions.

Missing number, treated as zero \" error To disable HyperTeX \" Can't write subdir/file.aux \" and other problems with write permissions during TeX processing \" ! Double subscript/superscript \" errors PDF conversion failure in papers with complex section structure arXiv system attempts processing with PDFLaTeX for submissions which are regular latex Why does my submission fail the automatic TeXing procedure when I use Feynmf? Why does my submission fail to recognize the main tex file? Problems with inclusion of binary or other bitmap figures; PS BAD warnings Absolute filenames When including figures/style/class/macro files, you must use relative filenames instead of absolute filenames. For example, myfigure.png is correct, while: /users/staff/fred/myarticle/myfigure.png is not. Absolute filenames make it impossible for anyone to use the source without modifying it. Unless your TeX system happens to have the same directory structure as ours, then our automated processing will fail. Upper-case vs Lower-case filenames If you use a computer with case-insensitive filenames (e.g., Windows), be sure that the case of any filenames referred to in your TeX file matches exactly the files that are uploaded. For example, the command: \\includegraphics{figure1.eps} will not work if the file is uploaded as FIGURE1.EPS because filenames are case-sensitive on our system. Missing style/macro files Some authors write their own style/macro files (or modify standard ones), but forget to include them with the source. Be sure to include with the source any style/macro files that we don't have. Note: non-standard style/macro files provided along with the source must NOT be attached to a paper. Instead, submit them as separate files, or use tar or zip to combine them with the source files before submitting. Last minute untested changes All too often, an author will make last minute changes to the source, but won't test it to see if the results will TeX correctly. You can save yourself a lot of trouble by testing that everything works properly before submitting your paper. User intervention Our source to postscript conversion system (called \"AutoTeX\") is fully automated . There is no genie present to answer questions such as: Would you like (P)ortrait or (L)andscape ? - answer P/L If your source needs to ask these types of question, please create a file called filename.inp (where filename matches the file it is to act on) that contains suitable responses. Your .inp file can be first tested on your local machine by running the following command: $ cat filename.inp | tex filename.tex Multiple files concatenated Do not submit several files all concatenated into one file, such as the Scientific Workplace's .rap file type -- such files cannot be separated automatically and may fail to process in unexpected ways. Instead, please create a .tar.gz or .zip file. Use of old or non-standard style files Style files change with time, and you (or we) might be using old versions of style files. We try to keep up to date, so if problems arise due to style files, please check that the version you are using is current. Some well-known style files, e.g., epsf.sty and epsfig.sty , have been altered by TeX programmers, then uploaded to web sites under the same filename. This is very bad practice and anti-social behavior, since we end up with multiple versions of standard styles. arXiv will make every effort to support the most recent and official versions of standard style files. As an example, the graphics and graphicx packages have been standard since the release of LaTeX 2e and are the recommended graphics inclusion macros. These packages provide the most portable and reliable method of including graphics. Style files incompatible with dvips Style files that are incompatible with dvips , e.g., epsbox.sty , can cause problems. If the DVI requires exotic versions of dvips (e.g., jdvi2kps ) to produce postscript, then our automated system will fail . Please make every effort to avoid using non-standard styles and dvi2ps utilities. Few people will be able to process papers in these non-standard formats. Sources that rely on something other than TeX or LaTeX All papers should be formatted so they work with TeX or LaTeX (as appropriate). If you use other formats (as opposed to style files or macros), e.g., AMS-TeX , AMS-LaTeX , or aatex , then please add the appropriate line to the top of the source, e.g.: %&amslplain for AMS-LaTeX (based on amslatex version 1.1), \\input amstex or %&amstex for AMS-TeX , and \\input cp-aa.tex or %&cp-aa for Springer-Verlag's Plain TeX Astronomy & Astrophysics macros, cp-aa (also known as aatex ). Anything that relies on something other than TeX or (PDF)LaTeX will fail. At this time arXiv does not support processing with: XeTeX and its variants including LuaTeX, LyX, or PDFTeX. Use of unusual/uncommon fonts Authors should keep in mind that if they use unusual fonts, many potential readers of their work won't have them installed. Because it would require significant admin time to install and maintain non-standard fonts, we do not generally support such fonts. It is, however, possible to include your local metafont .mf files as well as your local fontmap.map file. This will require special handling with a 00README.XXX file with the appropriate fontmap directive. Unprotected \\cite and other macros inside figure \\caption commands, \" line too long \" error In LaTeX, any citations inside a figure \\caption should be protected using the \\protect command; e.g., \\caption{Electron spectral function from \\protect\\cite{spectral}} . This delays the expansion of the citation until the second latex pass, i.e., when the reference has been defined. Marking files to be ignored If you need to include files in the source that should not be processed by the automated system, you may do either of the following: Add an %auto-ignore near the top of the file. This directive can be anywhere in the first 10 lines of the file, and anywhere on the line. It should appear before any TeX or LaTeX commands, since otherwise they would be recognized first. For example: %auto-ignore This is a README file for paper hep-ex/9901003 More data for our experiment is available at http://www.some.where/else Include a file 00README.XXX with your submission that includes the line: filename ignore for each file that should be ignored. \" ! Missing number, treated as zero \" error If you use epsf to include PostScript figures you must make sure that the %%BoundingBox definitions are near the start of the PostScript figure files. In order to reduce processing time, our TeX system does not scan the whole of each included file. If you have a file with the following structure: %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ... ... %%BoundingBox: (atend) ... [ bulk of PS file in here ] ... %%BoundingBox: 0 10 234 456 ... %%EOF then simply move the %%BoundingBox line to the top: %!PS-Adobe-3.0 ... ... %%BoundingBox: 0 10 234 456 ... [ bulk of PS file in here ] ... %%EOF To disable HyperTeX By default, our TeX system uses HyperTeX to add hyperlinks between references, sections and equations within your paper. These show up in the PDF (and in the PostScript with some viewers). HyperTeX conflicts with a few style and class files. If you think this is a problem, you can disable HyperTeX for your submission by including a file 00README.XXX . It should contain the line: nohypertex Note that HyperTeX changes the way citations appear in some styles -- ranges will be represented as [11, 12, 13] instead of [11-13]. This is necessary for HyperTeX to be able to make individual links to each citation. Unless you feel very strongly about this we recommend leaving HyperTeX on. \" Can't write subdir/file.aux \" and other problems with write permissions during TeX processing In our system, only the top level directory is granted write permission during processing. Attempts to write files to subdirectories will fail. All files included via \\include instead of \\input must be in the top level directory. This is because the \\include command attempts to write a separate .aux file in the same directory as the included file. For example: \\input{file} %OK, does not create separate .aux file \\input{subdir/file} %OK, does not create separate .aux file \\include{file} %OK because file.aux can be written \\include{subdir/file} %WILL FAIL fail because sub/file.aux cannot be written \" !

When processing TeX submissions with PostScript (PS/EPS) figures, or submissions comprised of only PostScript files, arXiv's AutoTeX system will attempt to convert the resulting PostScript file to PDF (which is by far the most common download format). Submissions that can be processed fine to this point may fail PostScript to PDF conversion for a number of reasons. Various fixes and work-arounds are listed below. Embedded % signs in PS/EPS figures Some graphics programs embed images as binary data. This leads to all sorts of characters appearing in the file, including ' % ' characters. A line beginning with a ' % ' character is a postscript comment, and by default dvips removes any postscript comments from included postscript files (for DSC compliance and to make the final postscript file smaller). Consequently any postscript files containing binary data can have random lines stripped out. To find the lines of a file which begin with '%' use grep '^%' fig.ps Any lines of binary data indicate a problem. Proper PostScript comments should be human readable, or at least contain only printable characters ( 0-9, A-Z, a-z ). To work around this, you can pass a special flag to our AutoTeX processor to keep all lines beginning with ' % ' (at the cost of portability). To do this, include a file 00README.XXX which includes an instruction specific to the filename of the dvi file for your submission, usually filename.dvi if your TeX file is filename.tex : filename.dvi keepcomments Errors in individual PS/EPS figures To debug postscript errors, run ghostscript individually on each figure. This should determine which one contains the problem; a valid postscript file should not produce any errors from ghostscript. An example of a postscript error detected by ghostscript is: $ gs fig1.ps Aladdin Ghostscript 6.01 (2000-03-17) Error: /limitcheck in --moveto-- Operand stack: 2147483647 0 Unexpected interpreter error -21. Current file position is 11858 The \" Current file position \" gives the character position of the error (e.g. in emacs, use M-x goto-char to jump to this point). The checking performed by ghostscript is strict. A postscript printer will ignore some errors in an attempt to output the file. However, it is worth making your postscript file work without any errors so that it can be viewed on screen. Trailing or leading garbage Trailing characters at the end of a postscript file will cause problems when the file is included in the paper (e.g., using \\usepackage{graphics} ) or combined figures. Note that trailing characters will not be detected by checking with ghostscript, since they follow the end of the postscript. Leading garbage, such as mail headers, can also cause problems. You can load the postscript file into a text editor to see if there are obvious garbage lines (e.g., your email signature file). Out of range coordinates Buggy graphics programs occasionally output spurious large coordinates which overflow the normal range of integers. For example, 2147483647 0 moveto Note that 2^31-1=2147483647 in the above example is a textbook case of common programming errors. Check for more recent and hopefully bug fixed versions of your graphics software. In particular, if you use ACE/gr (Xmgr), have a look at its descendant Grace . The offending coordinate(s) can usually be replaced by zero without affecting the final output, because it is usually followed by a valid moveto command which cancels its effect. Load the file into a text editor and zero the excessive coordinate, then, check that the resulting figure looks unchanged when viewed. Report the bug to the author of the graphics program you used. Figures encoded with 8-bit characters (^D) Figures containing 8-bit characters will appear fine individually, but may cause display problems when embedded in a paper. The problem with these figures is that they contain literal JPEG wrapped in a postscript envelope, e.g.: $ tail +172 Fig3a.eps | file - /dev/stdin: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), 72 x 72 This is perfectly legal to do, however the arXiv version of dvips cannot handle the 0x04 characters (i.e., ^D ) in the JPEG stream. In this case, it is not the format that needs to be changed, but the the encoding of the image data within the EPS file. One way around this is to convert the JPEG to EPS format using jpeg2ps with the -h flag to avoid the 8 bit data: $ jpeg2ps -? -b binary mode: output 8 bit data (default: 7 bit with ASCII85) -h hex mode: output 7 bit data in ASCIIHex encoding Beware of false alarms We do the PostScript syntax check with \" gs -DNODISPLAY ... \", and in rare circumstances this leads to spurious error messages due to missing device initialization.

This leads to all sorts of characters appearing in the file, including ' % ' characters. A line beginning with a ' % ' character is a postscript comment, and by default dvips removes any postscript comments from included postscript files (for DSC compliance and to make the final postscript file smaller). Consequently any postscript files containing binary data can have random lines stripped out. To find the lines of a file which begin with '%' use grep '^%' fig.ps Any lines of binary data indicate a problem. Proper PostScript comments should be human readable, or at least contain only printable characters ( 0-9, A-Z, a-z ). To work around this, you can pass a special flag to our AutoTeX processor to keep all lines beginning with ' % ' (at the cost of portability).

Many current word processors and graphics programs create excessively large PostScript files which include large amounts of \"postscript junk\". Macintosh and Windows programs seem to have the worst problems. Using programs on one of these platforms, it is all too easy to unknowingly create outrageously huge files. Such files will be much harder for readers to download, and some readers with poor network connections (such as in some developing countries) will not be able to obtain these files at all. What can I do about it? Authors who are aware of the problem can make an effort to check for \"junk\" PostScript, and even remove it manually from their files if necessary. The most common sources of unnecessarily large PostScript files are: unnecessary font inclusion unnecessary preview inclusion There are easy ways to avoid these, as described below. See also our sizes and bitmap help pages. Dealing with Unnecessary Fonts The most prevalent cause of huge amounts of junk in PostScript files is the inclusion of font information. For instance, simple figures often have labels or captions. If the font used for this is not in the standard PostScript font families of Helvetica, Times, Courier, and Symbol then the full font definition will be included in the PostScript file. This adds anywhere from 50-200kB per font (in some cases just to print a single letter!!). Some poorly-written software will even include all the standard fonts as well. This is intolerable, since every PostScript interpreter is required to have these four font families built-in already. You can check to see which fonts are included in your file by looking for %%BeginFont or %%BeginResource: font lines (and the corresponding %%End... lines) in your file. If you find non-standard fonts present (i.e., anything outside of Helvetica, Times, Courier, and Symbol), then you should try to find an option in your program to switch them to one of the four standard families. If you find font information for the standard fonts, you can safely slim down your file by removing them. Load the file into a text editor and manually delete the lines from %%BeginFont to %%EndFont (inclusive). After making any modifications you will want to check that your file still prints and views correctly, just in case any accidents occurred while editing the file. Dealing with unnecessary Previews Some applications, particularly on Macs and PCs, include a large uncompressed \"preview\" bitmap in every postscript file. This is supposed to allow a very crude approximation of the PostScript file to be rendered on screen when viewed in a non-PostScript viewer. This preview is low quality, and is superfluous for figures submitted to arXiv in any case. Previews are easy to find and eliminate. Submitters should look for any: %%BeginPreview lines followed by hexadecimal data (e.g., 092f62696e2f... ), and ending with: %%EndPreview Remove all the hexadecimal data and the %%BeginPreview and %%EndPreview lines to eliminate the preview completely. Note that the savings can be considerable. One example had two figures with preview bitmaps. One started as a 482kB file and slimmed to 154kB, the other was reduced from 550kB to 146kB!

As with previous updates, most of the TL2009/TL2011 advice below still applies. The new tree is based on the official TeX Live 2016 release with an updated tree of local addons. While most documents developed under TeX Live 2011 will process fine under the new TeX tree we encourage authors to switch their development environments to the latest TeX Live 2016 (if you have not done so already). Addons: Many modules not included in the core TeX Live release and maintained in our local tree have been updated to the most recent version, so long as the update does not drastically change or break existing documents. Modules with little or no recent usage have been dropped from our local tree. Please contact us if there are modules not include in TeX Live 2016 or our locally maintained tree that you would like to see added. In most cases you will want to add customized packages to your submission. Widely used packages may be added to our local tree for the convenience of large disciplines. More on package update policies: arXiv accepts thousands of articles every month. Our goal is to provide a stable TeX processing system where we are able to reprocess papers from TeX source at any point in the future. arXiv maintains all past TeX trees such that existing papers are processed using the TeX tree in effect when the paper was originally submitted. This preserves the original presentation (look-and-feel) of the paper. This forces arXiv to limit updates to our TeX tree once we move it into production since thousands of papers depend on the stability of the current tree. Introducing package updates that change existing papers is not acceptable. Therefore, once in production, we do not update the TL release via the tlmgr command. Special exceptions are made in narrow well defined cases for bug fixes that are critical to a large community of authors. During the development process the update processed introduced bugs and broke existing papers more than once so we are extremely cautious when it comes to updates. TeX Live Packages: Updating commonly used packages in the main TL2016 distribution is time consuming since we need to guarantee that existing papers are not adversly impacted by such a change. New packages: Adding new packages not included in TeX Live is possible by adding the package to our local tree. Updating existing packages in the distribution or local tree is difficult. Options for updating existing packages. One option is to include the modified package with your submission. Another option, for packages expected to be used by many authors, is to provide a modified version (that does not conflict with existing packages) that may be added to our local tree. If you see the need to include a large package hierarchy with you submission please contact us before including significant portions of a TeX Live tree. Our goal is to update our TeX Live distribution every few years. Since we maintain all previous trees the overhead of frequent updates is significant. This schedule will depend on the frequency of updates to TeX Live and the demand for these updates for arXiv submissions. We realize this is a major upgrade from TeX Live 2011 to 2016. The new tree contains thousands of improvements and bug fixes over the previous tree. Users may choose to replace older documents where such updates will improve the rendering of documents impacted by bugs in the previous TL2011-based tree. If you are replacing a paper with older TeX source that rendered fine under the previous release we strongly encourage you to carefully examine your final PDF. TeX Live changes that may impact some arXiv users: psfig : use of psfig to include figures. The psfig license is 'non-free' which is incompatible with the inclusion policies of the TeX Live organization and as such all support for psfig has been removed from the TeX Live 2016 release. From psfig's CTAN page : The psfig package is largely superseded, for various reasons, including its non-free licence. For new work, users are strongly encouraged to use the LATEX graphics bundle, specifically, either the graphicx or even epsfig package. In particular, epsfig, which is always to be found in modern distributions, implements a close analogue of the syntax of psfig. fix: update to modern graphics package for including figures. The TeX community recommends using the \\ includegraphics directive from the graphicx package which is part of latex-graphics - The LATEX standard graphics bundle. Issues currently under investigation: These issues currently involve packages from the main TL2016 distribution. tikz: figures with equations do not render properly with LaTex yet the same TeX source renders fine with pdfLaTex . We are working with TeX community to learn more about this issue. pdfpages/lscape/revtex4: unwanted page rotation This rotation problem was originally attributed to pdfpages but has since been attributed to a conflict between lscape and revtex. Recent versions of pdfpages now use lscape such that some of our users are experiencing unwanted page rotations. We are working to resolve this issue with the package maintainers. fix: include older pre-lscape version of pdfpages with submission. cleveref: unresolved citations leave ?? (Ex. 'Eq. (??)') in paper instead of citation number. 2017-04-25 Update: Summary: The problem of unresolved citations is due to the load order of the cleveref and hyperref packages. The hyperref package must be loaded prior to loading cleveref package. arXiv automatically includes the hyperref package when it sees the \\documentclass \\begin{document} directives. This results in the hyperref module getting loaded after cleveref module and since both modules redefine low level macros hyperref ends up redefining the ones cleveref defined earlier. In the past if the user attempted to load the hyperref package they would see option clash errors. These issues often resulted in authors disabling the automatic hyperref inclusion. Solution: Our TeX processing module has been modified to include the hyperref package before the cleveref package. This enforces the load order dependency and eliminates unresolved citations. The code has also been modified to recognize user included hyperref inclusion to eliminate options conflicts. Original fix: add \\usepackage{hyperref} before cleveref. \\usepackage{hyperref} \\usepackage{cleveref} Note: You no longer need to explicitly include hyperref package as our code now does this automatically before cleveref package. Old fix: include 00README.XXX file with nohypertex directive. In the event conflicts are due to system packages included in your paper you may still need to turn off our hyperref inclusion. An incomplete list of common symptoms, errors, and fixes follows: Wrong biblatex format version If you have been developing with an older biblatex you will need to regenerate your .bbl file.

Reports from users indicate there are problems with these packages in our older TeX Live 2011 system. We observed improvements to graphics in some TeX Live 2011 submissions that were processed under the new TeX Live 2016 tree.

In most cases there are fixes that can be applied and the submission replaced to correct the problems. Lines in the table of contents don't wrap Fuzzy fonts in PDF PostScript figures lose quality in the arXiv-generated PDF Extra white space around figures covers up some of the text Why don't the labels for my figures appear when I use Feynmf? Why are the margins different? Why is my text truncated? Why does my paper give the wrong date? Why do my citations appear in long form [1,2,3,4] instead of short form [1-4] ? Why do my user defined symbols (e.g., \\i, \\l, \\L, \\o, \\ae, etc.) display incorrectly in the processed document? Why are there problems with my postscript file? Why are some pages in the generated PDF file rotated and how do I avoid this? Lines in the table of contents don't wrap By default, papers are processed with the automatic addition of hyperlinks using the HyperTeX package. Hyperlinks in the table of contents can create a problem with latex's ability to break lines. This problem can be solved by passing the option linktocpage to hyperref. Include the line \\PassOptionsToPackage{linktocpage}{hyperref} in the preamble. This will create a hyperlink for the the page numbers instead of the whole table of contents line, and thus avoid the line break problem. An alternative solution is to allow hyperref to break links and thus wrap lines. To enable this, add the following to the preamble: \\usepackage[hyperindex,breaklinks]{hyperref} Fuzzy fonts in PDF If you use the fontenc package and T1 fonts you may find that the fonts appear fuzzy in PDF output from arXiv. Our suggested solution in most cases is to include packages ae and aecompl in the latex source. To do this add 2 additional lines after the fontenc inclusion: \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} \\usepackage{ae} \\usepackage{aecompl} CAREFULLY INSPECT the generated PDF for proper display of accented characters, character omissions, or other peculiarities. These problems can only be spotted by careful visual inspection, something which cannot be expected from arXiv admins and instead has to be performed by the author(s). Here are some pointers to entries in the TeX FAQ that address this issue: Quality of PDF from PostScript Fonts go fuzzy when you switch to T1 Choice of scalable outline fonts Finding '8-bit' Type 1 fonts Weird characters in dvips output PostScript figures lose quality in the arXiv-generated PDF arXiv uses Ghostscripts's PDF Writer device to generate the PDF versions of TeX submissions. A variety of parameters affects the conversion of PostScript to PDF. In particular bitmap figures are frequently downsampled to the target device resolution, and color spaces are converted as necessary. While arXiv's default settings, the defaults of Ghostscript's PDF Writer device, usually give reasonable quality, some figures may require individual parameter fine tuning for optimal quality of display and/or printout. Clearly arXiv's automated service cannot provide that level of individual tuning for authors. However it is possible to augment PostScript figures with hints (distiller parameters) to be used by the PDF converter. So authors can directly control the resulting image quality themselves via the following modification to their PostScript figure file(s).

Lines in the table of contents don't wrap Fuzzy fonts in PDF PostScript figures lose quality in the arXiv-generated PDF Extra white space around figures covers up some of the text Why don't the labels for my figures appear when I use Feynmf? Why are the margins different? Why is my text truncated? Why does my paper give the wrong date? Why do my citations appear in long form [1,2,3,4] instead of short form [1-4] ? Why do my user defined symbols (e.g., \\i, \\l, \\L, \\o, \\ae, etc.) display incorrectly in the processed document? Why are there problems with my postscript file? Why are some pages in the generated PDF file rotated and how do I avoid this? Lines in the table of contents don't wrap By default, papers are processed with the automatic addition of hyperlinks using the HyperTeX package. Hyperlinks in the table of contents can create a problem with latex's ability to break lines. This problem can be solved by passing the option linktocpage to hyperref. Include the line \\PassOptionsToPackage{linktocpage}{hyperref} in the preamble. This will create a hyperlink for the the page numbers instead of the whole table of contents line, and thus avoid the line break problem. An alternative solution is to allow hyperref to break links and thus wrap lines. To enable this, add the following to the preamble: \\usepackage[hyperindex,breaklinks]{hyperref} Fuzzy fonts in PDF If you use the fontenc package and T1 fonts you may find that the fonts appear fuzzy in PDF output from arXiv. Our suggested solution in most cases is to include packages ae and aecompl in the latex source. To do this add 2 additional lines after the fontenc inclusion: \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc} \\usepackage{ae} \\usepackage{aecompl} CAREFULLY INSPECT the generated PDF for proper display of accented characters, character omissions, or other peculiarities. These problems can only be spotted by careful visual inspection, something which cannot be expected from arXiv admins and instead has to be performed by the author(s).

TeX has many advantages that make it ideal as a format for the archives: It is plain text, it is compact, it is freely available for all platforms, it produces extremely high-quality output, and it retains contextual information . It is thus more likely to be a good source from which to generate newer formats, e.g., MathML [namely HTML, or more specifically XML, that handles mathematics correctly -- note that the MathML people plan a LaTeX to MathML translator, but dvi/ps/pdf lack the necessary document structuring concepts]. Possession of the source thus provides many additional options for future document migrations. Using emerging new technology, most of the Postscript generated from the source contains hyperlinks , so that using new versions of PostScript previewers (e.g., the next version of Ghostscript/Ghostview), readers can point-and-click to navigate within the paper, and even over the web itself. And by archiving the source, we maximize the potential for seamless adoption of future technological improvements. Archived papers can be repeatedly rejuvenated by automated reprocessing. We distill the source into Adobe's PDF format. The hyperlinks can then be viewed using Acroread or an equivalent reader . In addition, this means that the hyperlink overlay will be directly available to those web browsers with built-in PDF support (thus combining the network transport capabilities of html with a more serious page markup language). Having the paper available in PDF means that problems discussed below with Mac and PC browsers can be avoided. There is no single Postscript standard! We provide Postscript in many formats; this is not possible if the author submits a single Postscript file. For a historical example, Preview.app under NeXTstep displayed bitmapped fonts poorly, and for historical reasons (TeX predated common use of Postscript) these fonts are still most commonly used by TeX and dvips. By requesting type 1 fonts from the \"More options\" page, screen readability is improved. Cross-referencing within arXiv is added automatically with hyperlinked Postscript. Authors should specify arXiv:YYMM.NNNNN or the older format of arch-ive/papernum (e.g., hep-ph/9503456) references whenever available, and these strings will be pattern-matched and replaced with suitable hyperlinks back to arXiv. Similarly, any occurrences of http://... or ftp://... url's are detected and converted to hyperlinks. What is \"Contextual\" Information, and Why is it Important? We mean by this the relationship between equations and their labels, references and their numbers, subsection headings and their entries in the table of contents, and so on. While ordinarily readily available in TeX/LaTex source, conversion to Postscript irretrievably loses this structural information. The loss is unfortunate because with new formats such as PDF, the information can be used to provide active hyperlinks: e.g., in a PDF viewer you can click on an equation number and jump back to the specified equation. Moreover TeX itself can be processed as HyperTeX and, with the proper dvi previewer, clicking on equation numbers will bring up the desired equation in a separate window, or even retrieve other papers specified by their proper arch-ive/papernum identifier. HyperTeX works by redefining the standard macros and works retroactively for pre-existing TeX/LaTeX source -- HyperTeX conversion is accomplished by merely re-TeXing with the modified macros. Since information is ordinarily lost in each stage of processing, TeX source contains (close to) the maximal amount of contextual information that can be retroactively processed into any future format which can take advantage of it. For more information, see hypertex help . Why doesn't arXiv Accept Preprocessed Postscript Submissions? Postscript from TeX usually contains bitmapped fonts at a fixed resolution. Your favorite resolution is inappropriate for other users and may make your paper difficult or impossible to read. We will make available many versions of the Postscript including 300 dpi, 400 dpi, or 600 dpi bitmapped fonts, as well as Postscript with (un-embedded) Type 1 fonts. Different dvi to PS drivers produce Postscript that ranges from completely non-compliant with Adobe's Document Structuring Comments to only marginally compliant. We will always have the latest dvi to PS software installed and will produce DSC compliant PS. Postscript loses contextual information that is implicit in the TeX. This information is required to provide hyperlinked overlays to papers (so that users with the proper viewers can, for example, click on a reference number and jump to the reference [which can also include a web URL which can be automatically passed off to a web browser]). To do the hyperlinking, we use HyperTeX macros. The Postscript we produce is HyperPostscript which can be distilled into Adobe's Portable Document Format (PDF). Our software makes web URL's out of all references of the form YYMM.NNNNN or arch-ive/yymmnnn (e.g., 1510.00322 will be converted to a hyperlink for https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.00322, hep-th/9511053 will be converted to a hyperlink for https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9511053).

Any macros you use that we do not support can be included in your submission (or sent to us separately so we can put them on-line). Won't TeX source make it easy to plagiarize? There is no file format or other technological device that can protect you from this. At the very least, unscrupulous re-typers would always remain a threat. Postscript does not provide a barrier in any event: it is quite simple for someone with a little knowledge to extract any text from a Postscript file. Moreover a plagiarist who cuts-and-pastes directly from your TeX source is all the more easily detected, since the source is easily identified. We archive all versions of papers so that we can assist in any priority or plagiarism disputes. I worked hard to make my figures and I don't want people to steal them.

For detailed information on the current hypertex , please refer to the CTAN website . April 13th, 2008. HyperTeX is a defacto standard for inclusion of hyperlink information in TeX and LaTeX documents, which can then be used to generated PDF or DVI files with embedded links. These links enable easy navigation inside documents as well as between documents, just as in HTML, using standard PDF, Postscript and DVI viewers. Various TeX, LaTeX and BibTeX style sheets and macro packages exist which facilitate the construction of hyperlinked documents. Adding hyperlinks to a LaTeX document The simplest way to add hyperlinks to a LaTeX document is to make use of the hyperref package written by Sebastian Rahtz. It provides macros for constructing hyperlinks by hand, and it can also automatically construct hyperlinks for all the '\\cite' and '\\ref' commands. Hyperref is part of most modern TeX distributions. To use it, simply add \\usepackage{hyperref} to the top of your LaTeX file. See below for a more detailed example . You will also want to read the section below in order to find out how to make the PDF, Postscript or DVI file. Plain TeX users are referred to the hyperbasics.tex file written by Tanmoy Bhattacharya. Generating PDF/Postscript/DVI files with hyperlinks If you use hyperref, the DVI file which comes out of latex will contain hyperlink information which is recognised by programs such as xdvi. In order to create a Postscript or PDF file, you need to use the a hyperlink-aware converter such as dvips , dvipdfm , or generate the PDF file directly from the TeX or LaTeX source using pdftex . Viewing TeX/LaTeX generated output with hyperlinks Most DVI previewers, such as xdvi , dviout and idvi will display hypertex links without any further modifications. The same is true for most PDF previewers, such as Adobe Reader , recent versions of Evince and Xpdf . Using BibTeX with hyperlinks There are various BibTeX style files which automatically create hyperlinks to eprints available through arXiv.org . BibTeX entries which are compatible with these styles are generated by SPIRES, and look like @Article{Maldacena:1997re, author = \"Maldacena, Juan Martin\", title = \"{The large N limit of superconformal field theories and supergravity}\", journal = \"Adv.

There is a wide variety of options to influence the link style How it is all done internally TeX and LaTeX output is in the form of a \".dvi\" file, the letters being short for \"device-independent\". \".dvi\" files are not completely self-contained because they depend on external font files, but aside from that they describe the formatting of a document in a fashion independent of the display or printing device. The \".dvi\" format is also arbitrarily extendible, due to the \"\\special\" command of TeX, which allows new display commands to be embedded in the \".dvi\" file. The \"\\special\" command has previously been used to extend TeX by allowing inclusion of line drawings, PostScript figures, and colored text. HyperTeX adds five new \"\\special\" commands to the menagerie. These are: \\special{html:<a href=\"hrefstring\">} \\special{html:<a name=\"namestring\">} \\special{html:</a>} \\special{html:<img src=\"hrefstring\">} \\special{html:<base href=\"hrefstring\">} These are identified as HyperTeX specials by the first 4 characters, \"html\". The first three commands establish links between sections of documents in a manner exactly analogous to the HTML of the Web. The \"img\" command is intended to place an image of arbitrary graphical format on the page, although this is not very widely supported by current viewers. The \"hrefstring\" values are arbitrary URLs. If you want to use a fragment indicator in the URL (the `#' hash mark), make sure to change its catcode to `letter' first: {\\catcode`\\#=11 \\special{html:<a href=\"http://www.foo.org/bar#foobar\"}} See chapter 7 of the TeXbook for more information about catcodes. Rather than just applying these \"\\special\" commands directly, use of one of the macro packages (at least as a first step to \"hyper-izing\" a document) is highly recommended. The various subsections of a document can be referenced as part of a URL description through the \"#\" extension to the URL name.

In the future, the embedding html file will be able to specify an external URL from which pk files are to be fetched if they are neither available nor can be created locally.

Lasher Request For Comments: 1807 Stanford Obsoletes: 1357 D. Cohen Category: Informational Myricom June 1995 A Format for Bibliographic Records Status of this Memo This memo provides information for the Internet community. This memo does not specify an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. Abstract This RFC defines a format for bibliographic records describing technical reports. This format is used by the Cornell University Dienst protocol and the Stanford University SIFT system. The original RFC (RFC 1357) was written by D. Cohen, ISI, July 1992. This is a revision of RFC 1357. New fields include handle, other\\_access, keyword, and withdraw. Introduction Many universities and other R&D organizations routinely announce new technical reports by mailing (via the postal services) the bibliographic records of these reports. These mailings have non-trivial cost and delay. In addition, their recipients cannot conveniently file them, electronically, for later retrieval and searches. Publishing organizations that wish to use e-mail or file transfer to obtain these announcements can do so by using the following format. Organizations may automate to any degree (or not at all) both the creation of these records (about their own publications) and the handling of the records received from other organizations. This format is designed to be simple, for people and for machines, to be easy to read (\"human readable\") and create without any special programs. This RFC defines the format of bibliographic records, not how to process them. Lasher & Cohen Informational \\[Page 1\\] * * * RFC 1807 A Format for Bibliographic Records June 1995 This format is a \"tagged\" format with self-explaining alphabetic tags. It should be possible to prepare and to read bibliographic records using any text editor, without any special programs. This RFC includes the CR-CATEGORY, a field useful for Computer Science publications. It is expected that similar fields will be added for other domains. This format, as described in RFC 1357, was implemented as part of the Dienst system and has been in use by the five ARPA-funded computer science institutions to exchange bibliographic records (Cornell, SU, UC, MIT, and CMU). Programs have been written to map between this RFC and structured USMARC (format developed at the Library of Congress) cataloging records, also from USMARC to the RFC. The focus of this ARPA-funded research has been into many aspects of digital libraries including searching and accessing techniques that do not necessarily use bibliographic records (for example, natural language processing, automatic and full-text indexing). However, the continued use of bibliographic records is expected to remain an important part of the library system environment of the future and its use is an important link between the physical world of scientific works and the on-line world of digital objects. The format described in this paper allows a link between these two worlds to be created. This format was developed with considerable help and involvement of Computer Science and Library personnel from several organizations, including Carnegie Mellon University, Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), Cornell University, University of Southern California/Information Sciences Institute (ISI), Meridian (now called DynCorp), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and the University of California. Key contributions were provided by Jerry Saltzer of MIT, and Larry Lannom of DynCorp. The initial draft was prepared by Danny Cohen and Larry Miller of ISI. The revision was done by Rebecca Lasher from Stanford with assistance from the CS-TR participants. This RFC does not place any limitations on the dissemination of the bibliographic records. If there are limitations on the dissemination of the publication, it should be protected by some means such as passwords. This RFC does not address this protection. The use of this format is encouraged. There are no limitations on its use.

When needed, fields may continue over several lines, with an implied space in between. In order to simplify the use no special marking is used to indicate continuation line. Hence, fields are terminated by a line that starts (apart from white space) with a word followed by two colons. Except for the \"END::\" that is terminated by the end of line.) For improved human readability it is suggested to start continuation lines with some spaces. \\* Several fields are mandatory and must appear in the record. All fields (unless specifically not permitted to) may be in any order and may be repeated as needed (e.g., the AUTHOR field). The order of the repeated fields is always preserved. \\* Only printable ASCII characters are to be used. The permissible characters are ASCII codes 040 (Space) through 176(~) and line breaks which are \\\\012 (LF) or \\\\012\\\\015 (CRLF). Empty lines indicate paragraph break. \\\\009 (tab) must be replaced by spaces. This specifically forbids tabs, null characters, DEL, backspaces, etc. (i.e., if used, the record is invalid.) However full 8 bit ASCII may be used. WARNING: some electronic mailers cannot handle 8 bit ASCII and these records may need to be transported via other mechanisms. Throughout this document the word \"publisher\" means the publishing organization of a report (e.g., a university or a department thereof), not necessarily an organization authorized to issue ISBN numbers.

In the following double-quotes indicate complete strings. They are included only for grouping and are not expected to be used in the actual records. The BIB-VERSION, ID, ENTRY, and END field must appear as the first, second, third, and last fields, and may not be repeated in the record. All other fields may be repeated as needed. BIB-VERSION (M) -- This is the first field of any record. It is a mandatory field. It identifies the version of the format used to create this bibliographic record. This RFC defines BIB-Version TR-v2.1 BIB-VERSIONs that start with the letter X (case independent) are considered experimental. Bib-records sent with such a BIB-VERSION should NOT be incorporated in the permanent database of the recipient. Using this version of this format, this field is always: Format: BIB-VERSION:: CS-TR-v2.1 ID (M) -- This is the second field of any record. It is also a mandatory field. The ID field identifies the bibliographic record and is used in management of these records. Its format is \"ID:: XXX//YYY\", where XXX is the publisher-ID (the controlled symbol of the publisher) and YYY is the ID (e.g., report number) of the publication as assigned by the publisher. This ID is typically printed on the cover, and may contain slashes. The organization symbols \"DUMMY\" and \"TEST\" (case independent) are reserved for test records that should NOT be incorporated in the permanent database of the recipients.

If revision is omitted, the record is assumed to be a new record and not a revision. If the revision date is specified as 0, this is assumed to be January 1, 1900 (the previous RFC, used revision data of 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. this specification is for programs that might process records from RFC1357). The text before the semicolon in this field is a date of the form month day, year. Any record with a more recent revision date replaces completely any record with an earlier revision date (supplied either explicitly or by default). Use the text to describe the revision. Reasons to send out a revised record include an error in the original, or change in the access information.

Introduction Description of the semantics of the Open Archives Metadata Set XML DTD for the Open Archives Metadata Set A sample record expressed according to the Open Archives Metadata Set XML DTD Introduction The Santa Fe Convention provides recommendations for interoperability among archives. Archives provide access to records . The word document is purposely avoided and the notion of a record is purposely imprecise. Some archives may just provide access to metadata, others may also provide access to metadata and full content in some form, others may provide other services associated with the metadata and content such as access to the full content in various manifestations (formats) or structural decompositions (e.g., individual pages, chapters, and the like). This document describes the elements of the Open Archives Metadata Set (OAMS). The semantics of this set has purposely been kept simple in the interest of easy creation and widest applicability. The expectation is that individual archives will maintain metadata with more expressive semantics and the Open Archives Dienst Subset provides the mechanism for retrieval of this richer metadata. Notes on the remainder of this document: The transfer syntax of the OAMS is XML. A DTD is given at the end of this document. The semantics of the OAMS could be expressed using Dublin Core Element Set , with some qualification of those elements. Where the semantics of an element in the OAMS exactly matches that of one in the Dublin Core Metadata Element Set, the definition of the Dublin Core element has been used. Except where noted, values for elements are unformatted strings. All dates in OAMS are encoded using the \" Complete date\" variant of ISO8601 . This format is CCYY-MM-DD where CC is the century, YY is the year, MM is the month of the year between 01 (January) and 12 (December), and DD is the day of the month between 01 and 28 or 29 or 30 or 31, depending on length of month and whether it is a leap year. Elements that are mandatory are annotated with a [M]. Elements that are optional are annotated with a [O]. Elements that are repeatable are annotated with a [R]. Note that the fact that an element may be repeated implies that multiple values should not be associated with a single element (e.g., associating multiple authors with a single Author tag). Description of the semantics of the Open Archives Metadata Set Title [M] A name given to the record. Date of Accession [M] The date when the record was entered into the archive. It is assumed that in most cases this date will be created automatically by the archive rather than entered by a human user. Display ID [O] [R] A URL (Universal Resource Location) identifying a human readable page that provides access to the possible manifestations (e.g., PostScript, TeX) of the record. For archives that have only one manifestation per record, this URL may point to that single manifestation. Full ID [M] The full identifier for a record in an archive. This full identifier is the concatenation of the following components: A unique archive identifier consisting only of alphanumerical characters [a-z, A-Z, 0-9]. Registration of this identifier is part of the Open Archives registration process for data providers, described in Step 6 of the core document of the Santa Fe Convention . Any printable non-alphanumeric character that will act as a delimiter (e.g., / : #) An identifier for the record that is unique within the archive. The combination of these components produces a globally unique full identifier for each record in the nature of a URN. An example of a Full ID is archive11/xxx4. Author [M] [R] The author or corporate author who is responsible for creating the intellectual content of the record. Each author may also have an optional institution affiliation.

June 2019 11 June 2019 arXiv created a Systems and Control category eess.SY that will merge with cs.SY. We also merged the existing Numerical Analysis categories math.NA/cs.NA Two changes to arXiv categories were made today. The category for Systems and Control is making the move from computer science to electrical engineering and systems science, where it is a better fit. Users can still submit and search for cs.SY, however the canonical display will be eess.SY. The full description for Systems and Control eess.SY is at https://arxiv.org/archive/eess. arXiv is also merging the math and computer science categories for Numerical Analysis. The category description is: Numerical algorithms for problems in analysis and algebra, scientific computation. The merge will setup math.NA to be the canonical category for cs.NA. Thank you to arXiv moderators, subject advisory committees, and scientific advisory board members who provided leadership and input on these changes. Special thanks to our math.NA and cs.NA moderators for putting in extra effort over the past two month to pilot this move.

As far as researchers and arXiv users are concerned, the stewardship transition will be seamless and unnoticeable. Although the arXiv team is currently housed at the Library, the operation is independent of the Library's organizational, technical, and financial infrastructure. We have decided that CIS is better positioned to move arXiv forward into the next phase of the service's development after a careful assessment process. See press release and transition FAQ for more information.

Data sets uploaded in this way will be linked from the arXiv article. This is a pilot project in collaboration with the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Data Conservancy project. ScienceWISE provides article annotation and social bookmarking: Authors may now create annotated versions of their arXiv articles using the ScienceWISE service . Annotated PDF versions are linked from the arXiv abstract page. See, for example, arXiv:1103.5989v1 . ScienceWISE also provides social bookmarking facilities and a link and icon have been added to the set of bookmarking providers displayed on all abstract pages. Jan 2011 3 Jan 2011 Scheduled outages Tue 4 Jan and Sat/Sun 8/9 Jan: There will be a brief outage from 8am EST on Tue 4 Jan for server patching, accesses will be redirected to mirrors for most of this time. There will be a longer outage over the weekend of 8/9 Jan for major work on the power supplies for Cornell's hosting facility. The arXiv submission system and main server will be disabled at 7:30pm EST on Sat 8 Jan, existing articles will remain available from mirrors. Work is scheduled to be completed by 8am EST on Sun 9 Jan and the submission system will be available as soon as the work is complete. Bulk data available on Amazon S3: The bulk data available for download from Amazon S3 has been extended to include both PDF and source files of the latest versions of all arXiv articles. Nov 2010 12 Nov 2010 Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 25 Nov, 27 Dec, 28 Dec, 30 Dec and 31 Dec 2010; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 24 Nov 2010 through 16:00 EST Fri 26 Nov 2010 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 28 Nov 2010. Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 24 Dec 2010 through 16:00 EST Wed 29 Dec 2010 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 29 Dec 2010. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 29 Dec 2010 through 16:00 EST Mon 3 Jan 2011 will be announced at 20:00 EST Mon 3 Jan 2011. Note that articles submitted after 16:00 EST Wed 29 Dec 2010 will receive arXiv:1101.nnnn identifiers. Mar 2010 5 Mar 2010 New Submission System: We are pleased to announce that arXiv has a new submission system. We hope that this will improve the submission process for users and streamline administrative operations to help us keep pace with the ever increasing submission rate . Note that with the new submission system permanent identifiers are assigned only at the time articles are publicly announced. Submitters may edit, delay or remove submissions up until that point but this may affect the announcement order. Those interested in the announcement order should be aware that policies have changes such that: An update before announcement will reset any article's position in the queue. Announcement order is based on the last \"Submit\" action. An update after 16:00 EST/EDT will delay an article to the next day. 4 Mar 2010 Scheduled outage 5 Mar: The arXiv submission system will be disabled at 16:00 EST Fri, 5 Mar 2010 to allow software and hardware changes. The submission system and other facilities requiring login are expected to remain down for a few hours. Browsing will be supported at the main site for most of this time, and on our mirrors throughout. Delayed announcements 8 Mar: On Mon, 8 Mar 2010 we will delay the publication of new listings and the mailing of email alerts for new submissions from 20:00 EST to approximately 22:00 EST to allow software upgrades to be tested. Jan 2010 21 Jan 2010 Collaborative Support Plan Announced: Cornell University Library is beginning an effort to expand funding sources for arXiv to ensure its stability and continued development. We are working to establish a collaborative business model that will engage the institutions that benefit most from arXiv \u2014 academic institutions, research centers and government labs \u2014 by asking them for voluntary contributions. Our plans are outlined in the press release and in the arXiv support . Nov 2009 17 Nov 2009 Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 26 Nov, 25 Dec, 28 Dec, 29 Dec, 31 Dec 2009 and 1 Jan 2010; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 25 Nov 2009 through 16:00 EST Fri 27 Nov 2009 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 29 Nov 2009. Articles received from 16:00 EST Thu 24 Dec 2009 through 16:00 EST Wed 30 Dec 2009 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 30 Dec 2009. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 30 Dec 2009 through 16:00 EST Mon 4 Jan 2010 will be announced at 20:00 EST Mon 4 Jan 2010. Note that articles submitted after 16:00 EST Wed 30 Dec 2009 will receive arXiv:1001.nnnn identifiers. Jul 2009 9 Jul 2009 No new papers or announcements for 9 Jul 2009. arXiv administrators spent much of 8 Jul recovering from a problem with the main server (a corrupted database caused by human error on the evening of 7 Jul). During this time users were redirected to mirrors and submissions were not possible. We have thus deferred announcements of new submissions according to the following schedule: Articles received from 16:00 EDT Tue 7 Jul 2009 through 16:00 EDT Thu 9 Jul 2009 will be announced at 20:00 EDT Thu 9 Jul 2009. Apr 2009 8 Apr 2009 Public author identifiers have been introduced. If you are an author of articles on arXiv, you may opt-in to create a public author identifier which supports interaction with Facebook , a myarticles widget to allow dynamic inclusion of a list of your articles in web pages, and provides HTML and Atom feeds of your arXiv papers. Mar 2009 31 Mar 2009 A new Quantum Gases (cond-mat.quant-gas) subject area has been added: cond-mat.quant-gas - Quantum Gases Ultracold atomic and molecular gases, Bose-Einstein condensation, Feshbach resonances, spinor condensates, optical lattices, quantum simulation with cold atoms and molecules, macroscopic interference phenomena For more information, see the complete list of cond-mat subcategory descriptions . To subscribe to the daily e-mail notifications for cond-mat.quant-gas or a set of subcategories of cond-mat, you should first cancel your existing subscription, and then subscribe only to the subcategories of interest via physics. Jan 2009 20 Jan 2009 By popular request, the Astrophysics (astro-ph) archive has been split into six subcategories: astro-ph.CO - Cosmology and Extragalactic Astrophysics astro-ph.EP - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics astro-ph.GA - Galaxy Astrophysics astro-ph.HE - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena astro-ph.IM - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics astro-ph.SR - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics For more information, see the subcategory descriptions (including links to subdivided new and recent listings). This split should make announcements of new papers more manageable for those interested only in subsets of astro-ph. New astro-ph submissions must be assigned one or more subcategories. (Existing astro-ph articles will be machine-classified according to the new scheme when enough training data has been collected.) To subscribe to the daily e-mail notifications for only a set of subcategories, you should first cancel your existing subscription (either to astro-ph or physics), and then subscribe only to the subcategories of interest via physics. Dec 2008 4 Dec 2008 A new \"Quantitative Finance\" (q-fin) archive has been launched. For more information, see the announcement . It is partitioned into 7 subject categories and e-mail subscriptions can be made to any combination of subject categories. It has been \" preseeded \" with roughly 1700 relevant cross-listings and reclassification of articles from existing subject categories. Nov 2008 19 Nov 2008 Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 27 Nov, 25 Dec, 26 Dec, 29 Dec, 31 Dec 2008 and 1 Jan 2009; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 26 Nov 2008 through 16:00 EST Fri 28 Nov 2008 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 30 Nov 2008. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 24 Dec 2008 through 16:00 EST Tue 30 Dec 2008 will be announced at 20:00 EST Tue 30 Dec 2008. Articles received from 16:00 EST Tue 30 Dec 2008 through 16:00 EST Fri 2 Jan 2008 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 4 Jan 2008. Note that articles submitted after 16:00 EST Tue 30 Dec 2008 will receive 0901 identifiers. Oct 2008 3 Oct 2008 arXiv passes half-million article milestone: The 262 new submissions received between Wednesday 1 Oct and Thursday 2 Oct, announced Friday 3 Oct 2008, brought the total number of articles on arXiv past 500,000 -- all openly accessible. There are also more than 200,000 old versions of articles which record all public revisions since 1997. If the linear increase in submission rate continues, arXiv will pass the one million article mark in 2015. See press release for more details. Jun 2008 26 Jun 2008 Increased Size Limits: The automatic size limits have been significantly increased for all areas. They will now affect only a tiny fraction of submitters (<0.1%). We will continue to make exceptions for theses, dissertations and other necessarily large submissions, and offer advice on how to make large submissions more efficient (and thus more widely accessible). Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 4 Jul; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EDT Thu 3 Jul 2008 through 16:00 EDT Mon 7 Jul 2008 will be announced at 20:00 EDT Mon 7 Jul 2008. Mar 2008 12 Mar 2008 US NIH public access mandate: Recipients of funding from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding should be aware of a new requirement that publications after 7 Apr 2008 must be deposited in PubMed Central (PMC). See Cornell University Library advice on the new NIH public access mandate for more information and links to NIH documentation. This reporting requirement does not affect your right to submit arXiv. However, submission to arXiv does not satisfy the NIH reporting requirement. Feb 2008 16 Feb 2008 Hardware and Software Upgrades: Over the weekend of 1/2 Feb 2008 we moved arXiv to new hardware. This should allow us to keep up with the ever increasing traffic and make several improvements. One is that we now have a cache large enough to store processed PDF versions for all papers -- there should be far fewer \"...processing...\" responses. We have also put online several software improvements including: arXiv now accepts submissions in DOCX/OOXML format (from Word 2007 and other OOXML compliant applications). We have implemented version control for papers submitted prior to November 1997 in the same way as for papers submitted later. In many cases the earlier versions were not recorded and are marked as such in the comments (e.g. arXiv:hep-th/9108006v1 ). However, in some cases the earlier versions are now available in the usual way (e.g. arXiv:hep-th/9108019v1 ). Nov 2007 14 Nov 2007 Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 22 Nov, 24 Dec, 25 Dec, 31 Dec and 1 Jan; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 21 Nov 2007 through 16:00 EST Fri 23 Nov 2007 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 25 Nov 2007. Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 21 Dec 2007 through 16:00 EST Wed 26 Dec 2007 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 26 Dec 2007. Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 28 Dec 2007 through 16:00 EST Wed 2 Jan 2008 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 2 Jan 2008. Note that articles submitted after 16:00 EST Fri 28 Dec 2007 will receive 0801 identifiers. Aug 2007 27 Aug 2007 Note on recent administrative withdrawals due to plagiarism. Jul 2007 18 Jul 2007 There have been a number of upgrades to the arXiv interface and processing system since April 2007. These include: arXiv now supports PDFLaTeX . TeX submissions may now include PDF, JPG, or PNG figures using the standard \\includegraphics command from the graphics or graphicx packages. The article identifier system has been updated . The new scheme (which does not include subject information in the identifier) not only allows for a greater number of submissions each month, but it makes reclassification easier (old identifiers did not permit changes in primary classication after announcement). We also hope that the removal of optional subject-class information from the identifier will lead to more consistent citation and linking. To find a specific paper for which you know the identifier, you may now simply type or paste the identifier (e.g. hep-th/0501001 , 0704.0001 or arXiv:0704.0002 ) into the search box at the top of every arXiv page . This facility replaces the \"abs\" links for each archive that used to be on the main page. The abstract pages have been redesigned to more cleanly present the most important information (title, authors, abstract, etc.) and to allow more links to related services to be added in column on the right. See, for example, arXiv:0704.1252 The Statistics archive was introduced on 1 April 2007. The category math.IT was created as an alias for Information Theory ( cs.IT ) so that these papers will show in both math and cs searches. Mar 2007 8 Mar 2007 Change to arXiv identifiers now scheduled for 1 April 2007: The format of arXiv identifiers will change on 1 April 2007 (postponed from 1 January 2007). See Identifier scheme for new submissions beginning 1 April 2007 for details. Dec 2006 21 Dec 2006 Postponed change to arXiv identifiers: The format of arXiv identifiers will change early in 2007 (exact transition date to be decided). We have postponed the change from 1 January 2007 to allow more time for us and our collaborators to implement the required software modifications. See Identifier scheme for new submissions beginning early 2007 for details. 6 Dec 2006 Revised Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 25 Dec, 26 Dec and 1 Jan; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 22 Dec 2006 through 16:00 EST Wed 27 Dec 2006 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 27 Dec 2006. Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 29 Dec 2006 through 16:00 EST Tue 2 Jan 2007 will be announced at 20:00 EST Tue 2 Jan 2007. 1 Dec 2006 Change to arXiv identifiers: The current form of arXiv identifiers (e.g. [arXiv:math.DG/0307245](../abs/math/0307245) ) permits only 999 papers per month in any archive -- in October of this year we got to paper 989 in math, just 11 short of difficulty. We thus have an urgent need to extend the maximum number of submissions that can be handled in a month. We will certainly exceed 999 papers in some months for some archives next year. To address this issue (and several others), we are going to change the format of identifiers for new papers starting in early 2007 (original 1 December announcement said 1 January 2007, since postponed ) to use the form arXiv:0706.0001 . Nov 2006 20 Nov 2006 Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 23 Nov, 25 Dec and 1 Jan; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 22 Nov 2006 through 16:00 EST Fri 24 Nov 2006 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 26 Nov 2006. Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 22 Dec 2006 through 16:00 EST Tue 26 Dec 2006 will be announced at 20:00 EST Tue 26 Dec 2006. Articles received from 16:00 EST Fri 29 Dec 2006 through 16:00 EST Tue 2 Jan 2007 will be announced at 20:00 EST Tue 2 Jan 2007. August 2006 22 Aug 2006 Links to Grisha Perelman's papers, published only as arXiv.org e-prints are available below. Perelman was named a Fields Medalist at the opening ceremony of the International Mathematical Union. arXiv.org moderator Terence Tao was also named a Fields Medalist. See http://www.mathunion.org/medals/2006/ for information about the four medalists and their publications including arXiv.org e-prints. Grisha Perelman's papers on arXiv.org: 1. math.DG/0307245 [ abs , ps , pdf ]: Title: Finite extinction time for the solutions to the Ricci flow on certain three-manifolds Authors: Grisha Perelman 2. math.DG/0303109 [ abs , ps , pdf ]: Title: Ricci flow with surgery on three-manifolds Authors: Grisha Perelman 3. math.DG/0211159 [ abs , ps , pdf ]: Title: The entropy formula for the Ricci flow and its geometric applications Authors: Grisha Perelman April 2006 4 Apr 2006 We added access keys to our abstract and listing pages. Access keys allow users to activate certain links using keyboard shortcuts. Nov 2005 15 Nov 2005 Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 24 Nov and 27 and 29 Dec; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 23 Nov 2005 through 16:00 EST Fri 25 Nov 2005 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 27 Nov 2005. Articles received from 16:00 EST Mon 26 Dec 2005 through 16:00 EST Wed 28 Dec 2005 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 28 Dec 2005 Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 28 Dec 2005 through 16:00 EST Fri 30 Dec 2005 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 1 Jan 2006 Note: Submissions received after 16:00 EST Fri 30 Dec 2005 (21:00 GMT) will receive 0601... identifiers Oct 2005 11 Oct 2005 Software reversion : For the past three weeks, arXiv has not functioned reliably. We sincerely apologize for not providing the outstanding level of service that users expect. On 18 Sep 05, we installed new software to allow more flexible and robust classification of arXiv submissions. Unfortunately, the software did not perform as expected and resulted in difficulties and confusion for some of our users. To restore stability, we reverted to the software used prior to 18 Sep 05. We sincerely regret all inconveniences and are taking steps to ensure that future arXiv developments will be reliable. Thank you for your patience with us. Sep 2005 24 Sep 2005 Scheduled outage: At 4:00 p.m. EDT on Saturday, 24 Sep 2005, we expect an outage for improvements to Cornell University infrastructure. The outage is scheduled to last 18 hours. All services related to the main site (submissions, user account info, viewing the e-mail addresses of paper authors, etc.) will be unavailable during this time. People planning to submit papers on that day should either submit them before noon or plan to submit them on the following Monday. Readers should use one of our mirror sites to view papers during the outage. 16 Sep 2005 Software upgrade: There will be a disruption in normal service at the main site beginning at 4 PM EST on Friday, 16 September in order to carry out several software upgrades. The disruption is expected to last less than 24 hours. During that time, the main site will be available for browsing, but the submission and replacement services will be unavailable. People planning to submit/replace papers should do so either early Friday or on the following Sunday. In addition, papers received before 4 PM EST on 16 Sep will be announced at 8 PM EST that same evening , as opposed to the normal 8 PM EST Sunday time for papers received on a Friday. This will be done to minimize the possibility of errors with the software cutover. 7 Sep 2005 Physics reorganization: The physics section of arXiv will be undergoing an extensive reorganization. Over the last few months, the physics advisory committee members and section moderators have been extensively discussing a new organization and classification scheme , which would hopefully be implemented within the next several months. Jul 2005 25 Jul 2005 BitTorrent version of hep-th : From cartan.harvard.edu torrent.rutgers.edu you may download PDFs and text abstracts of the entire hep-th archive. The download is facilitated by BitTorrent technology to distribute bandwidth. Monthly updates are also available. Software for downloading torrents is available for Windows, Mac OS, and Linux at BitTorrent.com . Special thanks to Joanna Karczmarek for creating the BitTorrents, and Harvard for hosting them. Note : The BitTorrents are not supported by arXiv.org: send comments to Joanna Karczmarek. Nov 2004 11 Nov 2004 CoRR interface: A new interface for the Computing Resource Repository (corresponding to the cs archive ) was installed. It is still in the \"beta\" phase of production, but cs users are welcome to use it for uploading submissions, viewing listings, etc. Please report any bugs to www-admin@arxiv.org. 4 Nov 2004 [Modified 24 Nov 2004] Holiday Schedule: To enable our administrators to spend local holidays with their families, mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 25 Nov and 24, 28, and 30 Dec; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 24 Nov 2004 through 16:00 EST Fri 26 Nov 2004 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 28 Nov 2004. Articles received from 16:00 EST Thu 23 Dec 2004 through 16:00 EST Mon 27 Dec 2004 will be announced at 20:00 EST Mon 27 Dec 2004 Articles received from 16:00 EST Mon 27 Dec 2004 through 16:00 EST Wed 29 Dec 2004 will be announced at 20:00 EST Wed 29 Dec 2004 Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 29 Dec 2004 through 16:00 EST Fri 31 Dec 2004 will be announced at 20:00 EST Sun 2 Jan 2005 Sep 2004 29 Sep 2004 Search engine for user help pages: A new search engine for the user help pages was installed, with a search box provided at the top of each user help page. Jul 2004 23 Jul 2004 Scheduled outage: At noon EST on Sunday, 1 Aug 2004, we expect a scheduled outage for a planned hardware upgrade. Because we need to synchronize the database and other files between the two machines, we will need to disable incoming submissions for several hours. People planning to submit papers on that day should either submit them before noon or plan to submit them on the following Monday. If all goes as planned, it should be possible to browse papers on arXiv during most of the upgrade. If you do have problems, we recommend that you use one of our mirror sites. Features that require user login, such as viewing the e-mail addresses of paper authors, will be disabled during the upgrade. We'd like to thank Sun Microsystems for the gracious donation of a new server. The increased performance of the new machine will help us handle our continuing growth. Jan 2004 17 Jan 2004 Endorsement System: ArXiv initiates an endorsement system for new submitters. Initially, only a small fraction of submitters will be asked to provide endorsement. As the system is phased in, most new submitters will require endorsement. Existing submitters may not require endorsement for topics in which they have been active. arXiv is an openly accessible, moderated repository for scholarly papers in specific scientific disciplines. Material submitted to arXiv is expected to be of interest, relevance, and value to those disciplines. arXiv was developed to be, and remains, a means for specific communities of scientists to exchange information. Moderators and the arXiv administrative team have worked behind the scenes to ensure that content is appropriate to the user communities. The growth in number of submissions to arXiv necessitates an automated endorsement system. Current members of arXiv scientific communities will have the opportunity to endorse new submitters. This process will ensure that arXiv content is relevant to current research while controlling costs so we can continue to offer free and open Web access to all. For more information, see the endorsement help page. Dec 2003 4 Dec 2003 Holiday Schedule: Mailings and the public availability of new submissions will be deferred for 25,26 Dec and 1,2 Jan; the arXiv servers will otherwise remain in operation. These are typically the lowest activity days throughout the year. Articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 24 Dec 2003 through 16:00 EST Mon 29 Dec 2003 will be announced at 20:00 EST Mon 29 Dec 2003, and similarly articles received from 16:00 EST Wed 31 Dec 2003 through 16:00 EST Mon 5 Jan 2004 will be announced at 20:00 EST Mon 5 Jan 2004. Replacements received during these periods will not generate a new version number. Sep 2003 15 Sep 2003 A new \"Quantitative Biology\" archive, q-bio@arXiv.org, has been opened up for submissions. For more info, see this announcement . It is partitioned into 10 subject classes and e-mail subscriptions can be made to any combination of subject classes. It has been \"preseeded\" with roughly 2000 relevant cross-listings from existing subject areas. Jul 2003 6 Jul 2003 A new and more sophisticated author registration system has been put on-line. It provides greater administrative flexibility and better user support, including user ability to maintain past submissions. See register help for updated information. In order to improve the quality of the user-provided data, the legacy support for e-mail submissions has been phased out, in favor of exclusive support for web submissions. (The percentage of non-web submissions had decreased continuously in the past seven years to under 16%.) Dec 2001 13 Dec 2001 arXiv.org main site hardware operations transferred to the Cornell University Library site cul.arXiv.org = xxx.arXiv.cornell.edu Sep 2001 21 Sep 2001 Minor policy change: Starting Mon 24 Sep 2001, the deadline for submissions to appear in the daily mailings will be moved *three hours earlier* : to 16:00 US Eastern time (i.e., to 20:00 GMT, and 21:00 GMT during the winter) Monday through Friday, the first change in this time since 8 Jul '99 . The start of the mailings (and web interface update) will be moved to four hours earlier: to shortly after 20:00 Eastern time on Sunday through Thursday (i.e., to 00:00 GMT Mon-Fri, and 01:00 GMT during winter; the first change in this time since 7 Oct '96 ). Those submissions received between 16:00 and 20:00 EDT/EST will appear in the following day's mailing. Submissions received before the Friday 16:00 EDT/EST deadline will be announced on the following Sunday at 20:00 EDT/EST, and submissions received during the remainder of the weekend will be announced along with the Monday submissions (as since 15 May '97 ) on Monday night at 20:00 EDT/EST time. As ever, whether or not a submission makes the deadline on any given weekday is unlikely to alter markedly the future evolution of the cosmos. 4 Sep 2001 Administrative oversight for arXiv operations transferred to the Cornell University Library (CUL) , and configuration of the cul.arXiv.org = xxx.arXiv.cornell.edu mirror site proceeds. Dec 2000 6 Dec 2000 The automated software now recognizes and processes Mathematica Notebook files. For more information, see notebook submission help . Aug 2000 1 Aug 2000 South Africa users: note new South Africa mirror at http://za.arXiv.org/ , hosted by Department of Physics, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg Jan 2000 6 Jan 2000 The nlin-sys archives have been reorganized starting 1 January, 2000. The archives adap-org, chao-dyn, comp-gas, patt-sol, and solv-int have been subsumed as subject classes in the new \" nlin \" archive (see nlin info for more information). The intent is to bring these archives into conformity with the format of the newer archives, and to facilitate further expansion or reorganization. (Note that this also means these archives will now be updated -- and abstract mailings issued -- every weekday, rather than just once per week.) Beginning 1 Jan 2000, chao-dyn submissions for example should be sent To: nlin@arXiv.org with the added line (i.e. following Title:, Author:, etc.): Subj-class: Chaotic Dynamics and analogously for the other above subsumed archives. Submissions to chao-dyn@arXiv.org will be automatically rerouted as above, and assigned numbers beginning with nlin.CD/0001001. As a replacement for the cross-listing mechanism (between nlin archives), use multiple Subj-class: entries separated by ;'s (the first is the primary). It is also possible to subscribe to receive daily abstract notifications for any subset of the nlin-sys subject classes (see nlin subscribe -- current e-mail subscribers have been automatically transferred). Comments or suggestions for possible reorganization of the subject classes can be sent to www-admin@arxiv.org. 1 Jan 2000 Survived Y2K hysteria Dec 1999 31 Dec 1999 As previously announced , the xxx Announcements Forum has shut down at the end of 1999. For more information, see announcements . 1 Dec 1999 US users: note new US mirror at http://aps.arXiv.org/ , hosted by Brookhaven National Laboratory for the American Physical Society. Sep 1999 22 Sep 1999 New search interface at the main site. Incorporates better fielded searching, better boolean support, and much improved author name searching. The new search system will eventually propagate to the mirror network. Jul 1999 8 Jul 1999 Minor policy change: the deadline for submissions to appear in the daily mailings has been moved one hour earlier, to 17:00 US Mountain time (i.e., currently 23:00 GMT, and 00:00 GMT during the winter) Monday through Friday (the first change in this time since 4 Aug '96 ). The mailings will continue to commence (and web interface updated) shortly after 22:00 on Sunday through Thursday (i.e., currently 04:00 GMT Mon-Fri, and 05:00 GMT during winter, as since 7 Oct '96 ). Those few submissions received between 17:00 and 22:00 mountain time will appear in the next day's mailing. Submissions received before the Friday 17:00 deadline will be announced on the following Sunday at 22:00, and submissions received during the remainder of the weekend will be announced along with the Monday submissions on Monday night at 22:00 mountain time (as since 15 May '97 ). Jun 1999 29 Jun 1999 The xxx Announcements Forum is no longer accepting new registrations, and will shut down at the end of 1999. For more information, see announcements . 17 Jun 1999 Due to circumstances beyond our control, the Los Alamos e-Print Archive will suspend the ordinary database updates and mailings on Monday and Tuesday the 21,22 June 1999. For more information, see \" security standdown .\" Apr 1999 20 Apr 1999 The number of accumulated submissions to the archive has reached 100,000. See monthly submissions for the running count. Dec 1998 28 Dec 1998 New domain name arXiv.org registered. All of archive.org, archives.org, thearchive.org, thearchives.org were already taken. Since the word 'archive' has a Greek root, X indicates the Greek Chi, imitating Donald Knuth's usage in the scientific typesetting language TeX (pronounced Tech), also preserving at least one of the original three x's. Note also that the word archive itself goes back to the greek \"archos\" for ruler, or \"arche\" to begin or rule, where \"archeion\" was the government house, and led to the latin \"archivum\" as a place where public records or historical documents were preserved -- hence it was natural for what is now arXiv to have in the .gov domain. Sep 1998 15 Sep 1998 A new Computer Science archive, cs@xxx.lanl.gov , has been opened up for submissions. For more info, see CoRR . It is partitioned by Subject Classes (along the lines of the math archive, inititated in Jan '98), with 32 Subject Classes . E-mail subscriptions can be made to any combination of Subject Classes. The \"Computation and Language\" archive (cmp-lg) has been subsumed as one of the Subject Classes of the new cs archive. New submissions will be automatically directed to the new Subject Class (cs.CL), and e-mail subscribers have been automatically transferred to the new archive. Apr 1998 2 Apr 1998 Announcement: The Banach archive run for many years by Dale Alspach at Oklahoma State University has been merged into the LANL math archive. As part of this merger, two math subject areas have been created within the LANL archive: math.FA Functional Analysis Banach spaces, function spaces, real functions, integral transforms, theory of distributions, measure theory math.OA Operator Algebras Algebras of operators on Hilbert space, C*-algebras, von Neumann algebras, non-commutative geometry Please take care when classifying papers which you submit to the archive. Detailed instructions for modifying your set of subscription subject areas, adding or subtracting the above areas (or others), can be obtained by sending e-mail to math@xxx.lanl.gov with Subject: subscribe Mar 1998 30 Mar 1998 Note on upcoming reorganization of Mathematical Physics section: At the behest of the IAMP (=International Association of Mathematical Physics), starting 1 April 1998 the Mathematical Physics section of the archives will be reorganized to bridge the physics and the recently reorganized math groupings. The current \"Mathematical Methods in Physics\" subject class of the physics archive will be subsumed into a new \"Mathematical Physics\" archive math-ph@xxx.lanl.gov , to which future submissions should be sent. (If you are not sure whether or not your submission is physics, then it should be sent to math-ph). Submissions will also automatically appear under a \"MP = Mathematical Physics\" subject class of the math archive, and as usual can be cross-listed elsewhere. Current e-mail subscribers to \"Mathematical Methods in Physics\" will automatically be subscribed to the new archive. Current math subscribers can add the MP subject class starting 1 Apr. 9 Mar 1998 India users: note new Indian mirror at http://xxx.imsc.ernet.in/ Jan 1998 22 Jan 1998 The PDF produced here now includes subsetted embedded fonts. This was made feasible by the new font compression format (CFF/Type 2) introduced in PDF-1.2 (see 13 Nov 1997 ). This more compactified Type1 format reduced the byte cost of font inclusion by more than a factor of three. Note that not all PDF viewers support the font compression format (e.g. under NeXTStep, only PDFView.app (1.7) supports it; while the current versions of OmniPDF.app (2.1.3) and PDFViewer.app do not support it). Dec 1997 27 Dec 1997 The math archives will be reorganized starting 1 January, 1998. The archives alg-geom, dg-ga, funct-an, and q-alg will be subsumed as subject classes in the new \"math\" archive (started 12/97 -- see math info for more information). The intent is to provide a better organized framework for coverage of additional mathematical subject areas. Beginning 1 Jan 1998, q-alg submissions for example should be sent to math@xxx.lanl.gov with the added line (i.e. following Title:, Author:, etc.): Subj-class: Quantum Algebra (the AMS Mathematical Subject Classification(s) should now appear on an MSC-class: line). Submissions to q-alg@xxx.lanl.gov will be automatically rerouted as above, and assigned numbers beginning with math.QA/9801001. As a replacement for the cross-listing mechanism (between math archives), use multiple Subj-class: entries separated by ;'s (the first is the primary). It is also possible to subscribe to receive daily abstract notifications for any subset of the math subject classes (see math subscribe -- current e-mail subscribers will be automatically transferred). An external \"front end\" can be found at UC Davis front . 5 Dec 1997 Due to the healthy growth of the astro-ph archive, we are considering a Subj-class: organization similar to that which exists for the cond-mat and and physics archives. Suggested subject classes include: Cosmology and Large Scale Structure, Extra-Galactic Astronomy, Galactic Astronomy, Stars and the Interstellar Medium, Compact Objects, Planetary Systems, Stellar and Galactic Dynamics, High Energy Astrophysics, Instrumentation and Methods, History and Education. (The subject classes function effectively as separate \"archives\", though the collective astro-ph archive will of course continue to exist as well.) Please read astroreorg before sending comments. Nov 1997 13 Nov PDF is now produced with Adobe Distiller set to level 3.0. This produces smaller PDF files due to internal compression. Users of Acroread 2.1 and older need to upgrade to a more recent version of the PDF reader. 10 Nov Completely reorganized help texts on-line. Oct 1997 1 Oct 1997 All official versions of papers submitted starting in Oct '97 (i.e. with numbers >= 9710) are made publicly available through the archive Web interface. See versions for more information. Sep 1997 11 Sep The e-mail search and e-mail address databases at xxx.lanl.gov discontinued (due to limited usefulness and potential for abuse in accumulating bulk e-mail lists). 9 Sep China users: note the new Chinese mirror, http://xxx.itp.ac.cn/ , at the Institute of Theoretical Physics in Beijing July 1997 29 Jul Australia users: note the new Australian mirror, http://xxx.adelaide.edu.au/ , at the University of Adelaide. 21 Jul Added description of the correct way to refer to eprints within a paper . 11 Jul Important news for Windows users: the latest version of GSview can now read compressed files (compensating for the deficiencies in Netscape and Internet Explorer which fail to uncompress them). See Workaround solutions for Windows for details. June 1997 30 Jun Frequent complaints re multipart and gzipped files, see nota bene . 30 Jun Added information on the latest postscript drivers for Macintosh. These eliminate junk from the Macintosh postscript output. See the psjunk FAQ for details. 30 Jun Added a user-supplied .com file for automatically viewing compressed postscript on VMS . 14 Jun A user has kindly provided a Windows 95 batch file which automatically uncompresses postscript files for viewing, see Viewing compressed postscript - Workaround solutions for Windows . 13 Jun Added some information about viewing compressed postscript on VMS . 6 Jun For users in Germany, PDF is available on xxx.uni-augsburg.de , thanks to local support at University of Augsburg. Other mirror sites redirect to xxx.lanl.gov for PDF. Before trying to download PDF read the PDF setup instructions -- you need to download and install extra fonts to make the files viewable. May 1997 16 May Russia users: note the new mirror in Moscow, xxx.itep.ru , at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics. Japan users: note the new upgraded mirror in Kyoto, xxx.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp , at the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics. New papers arrive by 13:45 JST (within 1 hour of availability at LANL). 15 May Minor change in policy (affects only weekend submissions): the deadline for submissions to appear in the Sunday night mailing is moved back to Friday 18:00 LANL time (currently 00:00 GMT). Submissions received during the rest of the weekend will appear with Monday submissions in the Monday night mailing. After consultation with a large segment of the relevant community, it was determined to continue to delay the announcements of papers received on Fridays until Sunday nights (Monday mornings in Europe), rather than shift the Sunday mailing to Friday night. In a related development, responses to any queries received during the weekend may also be deferred until Monday morning (9:00 LANL time = 1500 GMT) -- Note that 99.97% of all e-mail queries are already answered in our comprehensive on-line help pages and frequently asked questions section. Recall also that any replacements received after the 18:00 LANL time deadline Mon-Fri constitute a new (revised) version. Please note that whether or not your submission makes the deadline on any given weekday is unlikely to alter markedly the future evolution of the cosmos. 11 May Spain users, there is now a mirror site at the Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain, xxx.unizar.es . Other users see our existing list of mirror sites . Updated information on Macintosh postscript viewers and added some info on a Mac shortcut to getting a bitmap version of any figure April 1997 Added a cookies form for selecting default viewing formats and classic icons. Renovated FAQ area has more workarounds for Windows and Macintosh browsers . March 1997 17 Mar Brazil users: note new Brazilian mirror, http://xxx.if.usp.br/ , at the Instituto de F\u00edsica da Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo . Added the question How can I submit a paper if I don't use TeX? to the FAQ. We are now using Thomas Esser's teTeX distribution as the base of our tex system. 4 Mar Israeli users: note the new mirror, http://xxx.tau.ac.il/ , at the University of Tel-Aviv. January 1997 19 Jan Taiwan users: note the new Taiwan mirror, http://xxx.sf.nchc.gov.tw/ . German users: note the new upgraded mirror site, http://xxx.uni-augsburg.de/ , at the University of Augsburg, December 1996 Added a Space Physics subject class to the Physics archive. November 1996 24 Nov Korean users: note the Korean mirror, http://xxx.snu.ac.kr/ , at the ICPR . 15 Nov New hardware for xxx.lanl.gov, provided under NSF contract. October 1996 7 Oct In order to facilitate feeding the european mirrors each night before the transatlantic links become congested, daily mailings and update of the web interface will now commence at 22:00 U.S. Mountain time Sunday through Thursday (currently 04:00 GMT Monday through Friday), i.e. two hours earlier. The deadline for submissions remains 18:00 US Mountain time (i.e., currently 00:00 GMT, and 01:00 GMT during the winter) Sunday through Thursday. 5 Oct e-mail subscribers to the physics archives: note that by subscribing to the corresponding subject classes of the new \"physics\" archive, you have the option to receive a single combined daily mailing (e.g. hep-th, gr-qc, and cond-mat). The option to receive separate mailings will of course remain. For further instructions, e-mail To: physics@xxx.lanl.gov, Subject: subscribe For general information on the new physics archive (partitioned by keyword subject classification), see http://xxx.lanl.gov/new/ 1 Oct 1 Oct '96 Reorganization -- Information on the following three topics is available: The physics archive Cond-mat archive reorganization Mailings from the physics archive as well as a brief philosophical synopsis . September 1996 24 Sep Experimental mirror sites are now operating in France, http://xxx.lpthe.jussieu.fr/ (Paris VI) and the U.K., http://xxx.soton.ac.uk/ (Southampton) joining the existing mirrors in Germany ( http://physinfo.uni-augsburg.de/ ) and Italy ( http://babbage.sissa.it/ ) and Japan ( xxx.yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp ). The latter two will soon be upgraded, and additional mirror sites are anticipated within the next few months. The goal is a more robust global server system (to avoid relapse to the medieval days when hardcopy took days, weeks, or months to arrive...). 24 Sep On 1 Oct '96, a new \"physics\" archive will go on-line, and is intended to facilitate growth into areas not currently covered. Submissions will be required to have a Subj-class: field that will effectively keyword partition the archive (for subscriptions, listings, and searches). Existing archives will for the most part remain unaffected. A very provisional list of canonical subject-classes be found at http://xxx.lanl.gov/new/physics , and can be modified as needed. Constructive suggestions solicited. 2 Sep nlin-sys archives (adap-org chao-dyn comp-gas patt-sol solv-int) consolidated from xyz.lanl.gov to xxx.lanl.gov. August 1996 4 Aug Minor policy change: the deadline for submissions to appear in the daily mailings has been moved six hours earlier to 18:00 US Mountain time (i.e., currently 00:00 GMT, and 01:00 GMT during the winter) Sunday through Thursday. The mailings will continue to commence (and web interface updated) shortly after midnight on those days (i.e., currently 06:00 GMT Mon-Fri, and 07:00 GMT during winter). Those few submissions received between 18:00 and midnight mountain time will appear in the next day's mailing. For the most part, this change will be invisible (and will primarily affect late night submissions from the US east coast, sparing us all the 2 a.m. typos...).

Thus, there is a strong tendency to cross-list from hep-ph to hep-ex. The \"management\" of the e-print archives discourages such cross-listing. The original reason for creating hep-ex as a separate archive is that there are many more theoretical papers than experimental papers, and so experimental papers need a haven from the deluge of theory. This purpose is defeated if excessive numbers of hep-ph papers are cross-listed to hep-ex. A paper should be cross-listed from hep-ph to hep-ex only if it falls in one of the following categories: 1) The paper contains a nontrivial analysis of experimental data (e.g., a new fit to parton distribution functions). 2) The paper concerns specifically the uses of theoretical results in experimental analysis (e.g., the announcement of a new Monte Carlo program for the radiative corrections to Bhabha scattering) 3) The paper offers a specific criticism of an experimental analysis (e.g., a note pointing out that a certain radiative correction has been omitted in a paper posted to hep-ex) The \"management\" thus recommends: 1) That theorists cross-list to hep-ex only papers in the three categories above. 2) That experimenters subscribe to hep-ph, thus removing the need for cross-listing. 3) That all users of the archive heap scorn upon authors who cross-list from hep-ph to hep-ex for the sole purpose of garnering extra publicity.

I learned to use mosaic the way most people do: by having someone who knew how to work it show me what to do. And that was click on stuff. (see explanation attached below) www = worldwideweb, originally developed at CERN for physicist use. mosaic is one of a number of www clients (for X, others include lynx for unix/vms/dos (vt100 mode); macmosaic (mac); Emacs/WWW; winmosaic and cello (windows); midas, tkwww, viola, and chimera (X); OmniWeb.app and the original WorldWideWeb.app (nextstep); and more). http://xxx.lanl.gov/ is an http URL (\"hypertext transfer protocol\" Uniform Resource Locator). at command line type Mosaic http://xxx.lanl.gov/ (similarly for lynx) and it will open to the specified url. (or if already running, punch the \"Open...\" button, 5th from left at bottom of mosaic window [or hit cmd-o in OmniWeb.app, or hit g in lynx, etc.] and paste in the url to open to the desired network resource.) then add to hotlist or bookmarks. the www interface on xxx currently processes over 5000 messages / day. while still a fraction of the e-mail activity, it has proven far more efficient and reliable (and now, courtesy of louise addis, includes citation searches linked through the spires database at slac) -- and will be the primary mode of access in the future.

Nov 14 1992 *** *** *** IMPORTANT MESSAGE CONCERNING FIGURE FILES *** *** *** there have been occasional problems with e-mail transmission of postscript figure files due to linelengths > 80 characters (and, in rare cases, > 1000 characters). in addition, cutting apart and renaming multiple postscript files can be tedious and annoying. SOLUTION: 1) all postscript files for a given paper should be submitted as a uuencoded compressed tar file. for this purpose, a unix csh utility called uufiles is now available (via `get uufiles'). it will prompt for filenames and create an executable uuencoded file that unpacks itself and cleans up. (this will also facilitate automated remote processing). 2) use the new `figures' (or `fig') command, e.g. Subject: figures 9211001 , to submit the uuencoded figures file after `putting' tex file of paper. this command insures that figures are mailed out as a separate file (and also suppresses the pipe through reform which can corrupt uuencoded files by stripping trailing spaces). uuencode/uudecode, compress/uncompress, and tar utilities are also available for non unix systems (but if you are not using a unix workstation, you should get one for yourself or your group [it will be many times more powerful than whatever you are currently using and is available at a fraction of the cost], and get it connected to internet.) future changes will not be downwardly compatible to dying operating systems. NOTE: 1) the `add' command remains, but now functions to concatenate additional pieces to (the last part of) a submission (necessary only for mailers that limit the size of outgoing files). (`add' continues to pipe incoming files through reform.) 2) `fig' command currently available only on four bull-bds based @xxx.lanl.gov Oct 16 1992 \\*\\*\\*NEW EXCITING COMMAND\\*\\*\\* (by popular demand): published. your preprint 9107001 has at last secured validation through appearance in a recognized journal, and you wish to advertise this joyful event to your friends and colleagues. you send a message To: hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: pub 9107001 Rec. Jnl. 180 (1992) 101 and the info is henceforth accessible via commands: find, list, list [].abs, and get [].abs, but will *not* be transmitted in the daily newlistings. note: this command is not yet installed at bull-bd's external to xxx.lanl.gov Sep 22 1992 NOTE TO ANONYMOUS FTP USERS: as some have discovered, if you ftp to xxx multiple times in succession you get denied access indefinitely. automated scripts for getting files should get multiple files in a single ftp session. european users should ftp preferentially to babbage.sissa.it, where databases are duplicated and updated daily. [this includes, among others, the domains .at (austria), .be (belgium), .dk (denmark), .fi (finland), .fr (france), .de (germany), .gr (greece), .hu (hungary), .ie (ireland), .it (italy), .nl (netherlands), .no (norway), .pl (poland), .es (spain), .se (sweden), .ch (switzerland), .uk (united kingdom), .yu (yugoslavia), ...]. xxx.lanl.gov may be up and down sporadically later in the week for disk diagnostics. all files are also available from babbage.sissa.it via anonymous ftp and e-mail request. REMINDER: european users should ftp and send e-mail get requests preferentially to hep-th@babbage.sissa.it, where databases are duplicated and updated daily. [this includes, among others, the domains .at (austria), .be (belgium), .dk (denmark), .fi (finland), .fr (france), .de (germany), .gr (greece), .hu (hungary), .ie (ireland), .it (italy), .nl (netherlands), .no (norway), .pl (poland), .es (spain), .se (sweden), .ch (switzerland), .uk (united kingdom), .yu (yugoslavia), ..., unless you are absolutely convinced that you are \"closer\" to new mexico in the network metric] hep-ph and gr-qc are also duplicated @babbage.sissa.it ftp to xxx has been provisionally cut off to some domains (notably .it, .ch, .uk) whose voluntary cooperation could not be elicited (thank you very much). selective filtering of e-mail `get's will follow if necessary. Sep 16 1992 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \\\\ hep-th/9209055 replaced with revised version Wed, 16 Sep 1992 10:01:01 CDT Quantum Aspects of Black Holes, J. A. Harvey and A. Strominger, 54 pages with 16 figures (as two uuencoded compressed tar files), harvmac, EFI-92-41. only change: figure file split into two separate files to forestall confusion. MESSAGE OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE CONCERNING hep-th/9209055: the 16 figures for this paper had been (correctly) submitted as a single uuencoded compressed tar file using the `add' command. the uuencoded file exceeded 100kb so was split up by the outgoing mail routine for e-mail requestors (due to limits imposed by certain mail routers). NOW HERE COMES THE SUBTLE PART: *your* unix mailer, on *receipt* of this mail, adds both a header *and* a blank line at the end of the file. that means if you mindlessly concatenated the two parts after removing headers with an editor, the *blank line* prevented proper uudecoding and you lost three figures. if you as well removed the blank line, then everything worked fine. BUT THERE IS A BETTER WAY: all modern unix mailers have a command w (for write) in addition to s (for save). the w command automatically strips off the header and trailing blank line, so you can simply say, for example, w 1 2 figures.enc to combine mail messages 1 and 2 into an uncorrupted file figures.enc without header. if your mailer does not have a properly functioning w command, you should complain. (while this system does not make commercial endorsements, it should be noted that at least one unix operating system has as well a mail application that automatically uuencodes and tar compresses multiple files dragged into the send window, and performs the inverse process on receipt of mail.) there also exist uudecode, tar, and uncompress utilities for vaxes. there is little excuse for persistent postscript figure fear. Aug 4 1992 the full preprint databases hep-th, hep-ph, and gr-qc at xxx.lanl.gov are duplicated at babbage.sissa.it (italy), and automatically updated once a day (shortly after the daily mailings go out). you decide which address is more efficient for e-mail and anonymous ftp, e.g. european addresses can avoid the electronic trans-atlantic round trip by sending messages to hep-th@babbage.sissa.it, hep-ph@babbage.sissa.it, or gr-qc@babbage.sissa.it. if you enjoy requesting the same paper multiple times within a 5 minute period, babbage.sissa.it is the place to do it. if you need to practice anonymous ftp, babbage.sissa.it is the place to do it. commands that change the database (put replace add cross, subscribe cancel) must still be sent to xxx.lanl.gov for the time being. other commands (get find listings ...) are identical to those on xxx.lanl.gov. Aug 2 1992 in response to popular demand, an automated e-mail address database for physicists, e-mail@xxx.lanl.gov is now operational. commands are: subscribe, cancel, find, help, comment to enter yourself, send a message To: e-mail@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: subscribe your full name where \"your full name\" is your name, not your e-mail address (the latter is extracted automatically from mail header). [ alternative e-mail addresses or pseudonyms can also be entered, e.g. From: mozart@boojum.cornell.edu Subject: subscribe N.D.Mozart, N.David Mozart,David Mozart; mozart@lassp.bitnet results in the entry mozart@boojum.cornell.edu N. D. Mozart, N. David Mozart,David Mozart; mozart@lassp.bitnet ] to find an e-mail address, send a message To: e-mail@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: find mozart it will probably take a few days for addresses to accumulate. feel free to share this message with your esteemed colleagues. Note: receipt of this message does NOT mean that your address has been entered. you must manually subscribe yourself to be entered. entries will be deleted automatically after one year, at which time you will receive a reminder to resubscribe. participation is voluntary. Aug 1 1992 1) the get command defaults to the current year/month. currently get 1 is equivalent to get 9207201 , and numbers too large for current yr/mo default to previous yr/mo. currently get 85 is equivalent to get 9206285 . this helps to avoid typos. 2) the get command allows multiple requests, e.g. get 9206265 9207201 will return the two requested papers (in separate files). this helps to avoid unnecessary waste of network resources. 3) (1) + (2) ==> get 65 1 2 is currently equivalent to get 9206285 9207201 9207202 ***(REALLY WORKS, TRY IT...)*** this helps to avoid typos and unnecessary waste of network resources. it is not necessary to say get hep-ph/9207201 . if you send To: hep-ph@xxx.lanl.gov, then it is understood. if you do not send To: hep-ph, then you get nothing. it is also not necessary to say get paper#9207201 , and it is not necessary to enclose commands in ` 's. Jul 19 1992 1) new bulletin board: gr-qc@xxx.lanl.gov (general relativity / quantum cosmology) to subscribe, send a message To: gr-qc@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: subscribe your full name (Note: suscribe is not a word, and \"your full name\" is your name, as you wish it to appear on distribution list) gr-qc is a distinct bulletin board with a distinct distribution list, submissions and requests for papers must be sent To: gr-qc@xxx.lanl.gov . 2) the find command has been modified to default to past 12 months Subject: find abc currently defaults to listings from 9108 - 9207 for previous years use an additional argument, e.g. Subject: find abc 91 finds all occurrences of abc in title/author list for year '91 multiword searches still work. Jul 14 1992 all files up to and including 9205 are now stored in compressed form. the change is transparent via email access, since the mailout routine automatically untars and uncompresses before sending. via anonymous ftp, get the .Z (or .tar.Z) file in binary mode and uncompress (and untar) remotely (ftp README for instructions). in addition, files will no longer be stored in < 100kb pieces (unless they are explicitly submitted that way via the `add' command) but will instead be broken up as they are sent out. all files more than one month old will be recombined and compressed on an ongoing basis, primarily to facilitate ftp access. Jul 7 1992 all files from '91 are now stored in compressed form. the change is transparent via email access, since the mailout routine automatically untars and uncompresses before sending (intermittent problems getting [still heavily accessed] '91 files during brief changeover period are settled). via anonymous ftp, get the .Z (or .tar.Z) file in binary mode and uncompress (and untar) remotely. files will no longer be stored in < 100kb pieces (unless they are explicitly submitted that way via the `add' command), but will instead be broken up as they are sent out. all files more than one month old will soon be recombined and compressed on an ongoing basis. this is the first step in the advertised direction of storing only tar-compressed .dvi + .ps files. this is also the second warning that if you are not already on a unix system connected to internet, you should stop procrastinating and get one for yourself or for your group. (such a system will be many times more powerful than whatever you are currently using and is available at a fraction of the cost.) Jul 5 1992 1) the get command defaults to the current year/month. currently get 1 is equivalent to get 9207001, and numbers too large for current yr/mo default to previous yr/mo. currently get 110 is equivalent to get 9206110. this helps to avoid typos. 2) the get command allows multiple requests, e.g. get 9206110 9207001 will return the two requested papers (in separate files). this helps to avoid unnecessary waste of network resources. 3) (1) + (2) ==> get 110 1 2 is currently equivalent to get 9206110 9207001 9207002 ***(REALLY WORKS, TRY IT...)*** this helps to avoid typos and unnecessary waste of network resources. it is not necessary to say get hep-th/9207001. if you send To: hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov, then it is understood. if you do not send To: hep-th, then you get nothing. it is also not necessary to say get paper#9207001, and it is not necessary to enclose commands in ` 's. Jun 4 1992 **READTHISREADTHISREADTHISEDUTITPENIGNILGGOBDNIMEROMREADTHISREADTHISREADTHIS*** some macro packages are available from hep-ph. suppose e.g. you have gotten a paper that says \\input harvmac . rather than fret away the remainder of your day, you send a message to hep-ph with Subject: get harvmac . for a list of other macro packages available from here, use `list macros' May 26 1992 new command: the cross-list (or cross or cro) command allows cross-listing papers between different bulletin boards. suppose for example you are convinced that your recent exciting research is of crucial interest to both hep-lat and hep-th lists, but you incisively realize that it is silly to store it in both places. you proceed as follows: 1) you can e.g. first `put' it to hep-lat To: hep-lat@ftp.scri.fsu.edu Subject: put where it is assigned a number, say hep-lat/9205090. 2) next you send the same title and abstract fields, delineated by three \\\\'s in the usual way (sending body as well is harmless, it will be ignored), To: hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: cross hep-lat/9205090 this will generate an abstract entry on hep-th with a pointer to hep-lat, i.e. Paper (*cross-listing*): hep-lat/9205090 which appears in daily listings and is as well accessed by find, list, and list .abs commands. users of course need to be incredibly alert to recognize that cross-listed papers can only be retrieved from the bulletin board where they are stored, e.g. in this case via To: hep-lat@ftp.scri.fsu.edu Subject: get 90 (when getting papers note that the full bull-board/papernum is not necessary, for a request sent To: the correct bull-board address, simply `get papernum' is sufficient. and if you request to the wrong address, nothing will suffice.) a drawback to this procedure is that the full email addresses of hep-lat and other cross-listed bull-boards need to be generally known. a list of known addresses has been added to the help texts. in addition, mail to hep-lat@xxx.lanl.gov, cond-mat@xxx..., etc., is automatically forwarded (in general this is less efficient and is preferably avoided once you have learned the correct address). finally, an extra argument to cross, e.g. To: hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: cross lc-om/9205090 lc-om@alcom-p.cwru.edu can be used to include a possibly obscure address in the listing entry. if you replace your paper on the remote bulletin board (e.g. hep-lat as above), then a message, again with only (revised) title/abstract delineated by \\\\'s, To: hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: replace hep-lat/9205090 will generate a replacement notification on the daily hep-th listings, so that those subscribers as well can instantly learn of your corrected references. papers submitted over the past few months can be cross-listed. this method of cross-listing is far from fool-proof, but most easily accommodates an ever growing number of bull-boards that continue to operate quasi-independently. May 10 1992 the slac library has requested that authors include in the title listing the institutional number assigned to their preprint, typically already included in the body of the text, e.g. \\\\ Recent Seminal Results, by Author One and Author Two, 3 pages, EFI-92-15 \\\\ Carol Chatfield, SLAC Library email carolfey@slacvm.stanford.edu writes: \"We search the SLAC HEP database BEFORE printing out the papers we get in our subscription. At first, we use the abstract listing which does not currently include report #. Author/title searching is much cruder than report # searching. Institutional numbers should be in the format: \"INST (Series) YY-NO\" e.g. ANL-HEP-PR-92-27 (Argonne Natl. Lab High Energy Physics Preprint 1992 27th report). Each institute generally has its own series, but if help is needed setting up a report series, authors can contact Bob Gex at SLAC: LIRYG@slacvm.stanford.edu for help.\" May 6 1992 by popular request, again these are some other preprint bulletin boards (with more imminent): alg-geom@publications.math.duke.edu (algebraic geometry, 460 subscribers) astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it (astrophysics, 169) cond-mat@babbage.sissa.it (condensed matter, 240) funct-an@babbage.sissa.it (functional analysis, 61) hep-lat@ftp.scri.fsu.edu (computational and lattice physics, 245) hep-ph@xxx.lanl.gov (high energy physics phenomenological, 564) hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov (high energy physics formal, 1075) (funding agencies are informed of the ratio of the last two, as well as the far more shocking th/ph \"Interest Quotient\" of avg #requests/paper) May 5 1992 reform.c has a minor bug corrected, and now recognizes that \\% is a percent sign, not a comment (formerly a problem only on lines with \\% that were subsequently wrapped). get reform.c for updated version. someone has provided a reform.exec written in rexx and intended for hapless ibm vm users. it splits long lines in files so your mailer will not butcher them. (N.B. cernvm et al.: {\\it no more excuses\\/} for sending out garbled files.) put now translates hep-th/yymmnnn to hep-th/papernum (e.g. hep-th/9205010) if you wish to have the number appear in the file. it is *not* necessary to specify hep-th/ when getting papers from hep-th@xxx May 2 1992 on any given day, roughly 1% of the mailers in the world intermittently bounce perfectly legitimate mail (\"hostname not recognized as local\", \"can't find user\", \"can't find network\", \"timeout\", \"unable to transfer\", \"insufficient disk allocation\",..., ***ALL*** from non-unix mailers; prime offenders are italian, brazilian, british, and japanese network routers) and this adds up for any system that processes thousands of messages per day. mayday (i.e. m'aider, not may fool's) message: there are now roughly 1050 addresses on the hep-th list, and over 550 on the hep-ph list (a large fraction on both conjectured to be users primarily desiring daily verification of their electronic network connectivity). they are distinct, and papers should be submitted to the correct place; there really is an automated referee system that has occasionally rerouted submissions, but it is not fool-proof. a means for cross-linking submissions between bulletin boards is under careful consideration (in the meantime do not submit to more than one), patience. there has emerged a minor problem with large files. while storage @xxx is not an issue, most unsuspecting requestors do not wish to be bombarded with 2Mb of inefficiently generated postscript in 20 separate files, or 1Mb of tables of calabi-yau intersection numbers (yes, these things happen). moreover there are many vax vms and ibm vm systems that will reject most of this mail due to unsuspecting requestor's insufficent disk allocation. the long-term solution for preprint distribution is as follows: most files will be made available directly from their source in tar-compressed form via anonymous ftp (or other info servers soon to be on-line) and only lists of titles/abstracts will be routed through a central distribution point. such distributed access is already provided by many sites, more will follow. due to current system and network incompatibilities, it will undoubtedly take more than a year to fully implement this stage. in the meantime, submissions should be limited to under 300kb (600 blocks) (as has already been the case for over 99% of submissions anyway), with a note explaining how to obtain any additional figure files, etc. via mail, anonymous ftp, or other) in addition, if you are not using a unix workstation you should get one for yourself or your group (it will be many times more powerful than whatever you are currently using and is available at a fraction of the cost), and get it connected to internet. a far friendlier environment for electronic networking will result when the last ibm vm and .bitnet are mercifully eradicated from the face of the earth. Apr 14 1992 do not submit the same paper to more than one bulletin board. a means of cross-linking interdisciplinary papers will eventually be provided. Apr 10 1992 astro-ph, cond-mat, and funct-an archives installed at babbage.sissa.it (PG). [using same software already designed, implemented, and running at Los Alamos since Aug '91, and already installed remotely for the hep-lat and alg-geom archives] Apr 7 1992 hep-lat archive installed at ftp.scri.fsu.edu, running same software as at xxx.lanl.gov Apr 6 1992 due to a software change, if you are using a mail alias to send mail to hepth, your alias must contain either the string hepth or hep-th. otherwise your mail will be rejected. 1 Apr 1992 \\Paper: 9203227 From: harvey@witten.uchicago.edu (J. B. Harvey) Date: Wed 1 Apr 1992 00:25 CST 1992 A solvable string theory in four dimensions, by J. Harvey, G. Moore, N. Seiberg, and A. Strominger, 30 pp \\ We construct a new class of exactly solvable string theories by generalizing the heterotic construction to connect a left-moving non-compact Lorentzian coset algebra with a right-moving supersymmetric Euclidean coset algebra. These theories have no spacetime supersymmetry, and a generalized set of anomaly constraints allows only a model with four spacetime dimensions, low energy gauge groups SU(3) and spontaneously broken SU(2)xU(1), and three families of quarks and leptons. The model has a complex dilaton whose radial mode is automatically eaten in a Higgs-like solution to the cosmological constant problem, while its angular mode survives to solve the strong CP problem at low energy. By adroit use of the theory of parabolic cylinder functions, we calculate the mass spectrum of this model to all orders in the string loop expansion. The results are within 5% of measured values, with the discrepancy attributable to experimental error. We predict a top quark mass of $173 \\pm 2$ GeV, and no physical Higgs particle in the spectrum. \\\\ Mar 31 1992 REPLACED PAPERS: numerous people have requested that submitters of replaced papers include a (commented out) header in the revised body of the paper that overviews the changes. in addition a brief parenthetical note following the revised title should indicate the nature of the changes (e.g. major conceptual changes, minor grammatical changes, corrected references, corrected authors, corrected tex errors, ...) Mar 11 1992 local network reconfiguration delayed until unknown time thu 12 Mar between 0100 - 0600 MST (0900 - 1400 GMT). random mail delays likely throughout day. new IP# for xxx.lanl.gov to be 128.165.23.9 (although should never be necessary for systems properly configured to use remote lookup tables). this system has logged an increasing number of attempts at telnet access. there is no reason to telnet to xxx.lanl.gov. if you are trying to use anonymous ftp, then type `ftp', not `telnet'. this system also screens ftp access for forged packets (a standard hacker game) by tracing back and confirming remote hostname. occasionally this has meant denied access to legitimate requests from improperly configured machines: if you have this problem, it will continue until it is fixed at your end. (there is of course in general little concern about access by physicists, but there are many other potential sources of access, hence precautions.) Mar 8 1992 recent stunning development: a high energy phenomenology bulletin board hep-ph@xxx.lanl.gov has provisionally started alongside hepth@xxx.lanl.gov. after new software is evaluated, it will be decided if and where to move it (warning: there may be intermittent problems with the nightly distribution during burn-in phase). to subscribe, send a message to hep-ph@xxx.lanl.gov with Subject: subscribe yourfirstname yourlastname where `yourfirstname yourlastname' is replaced by your name which can have any number of words and initials (first 1000 subscribers receive special charter membership). most other commands are identical to hepth (a.k.a. hep-th), for more information send a `help' request to hep-ph. for anonymous ftp access, the papers and listings directories are now hep-th/papers hep-th/listings hep-ph/papers hep-ph/listings . for the time being, papers may be submitted only to one or the other bulletin board (a means of cross-linking may be made available later on). if you are confused about where to submit, use hep-ph the phenomenology part (whose automated referee system remains in observer mode until its dynamic syntactic analyzer has collected enough data to conform reliably to popularly dictated tastes, such as they are). Feb 26 1992 UPDATE: hep-th now has roughly 900 subscribers. the automated referee system has been rejecting roughly one \"phenomenology\" paper per day (please stop submitting them). if ssc.gov will require a canonical 10 years to provide the promised resources for a phenomenology bulletin board, another location should materialize by early april. (clones of this system are already operating in other disciplines, and the procedure takes only a few minutes.) for further illuminating background information about this system and its successors, `get letter.tex' Feb 10 1992 in response to requests for a means of including the 7 digit papernumber directly in submitted files (typically to appear on the title page), `put' translates any occurrence of the sequence: hepth@xxx/yymmnnn (must be exactly as above) to hepth@xxx/paperno (e.g. hepth@xxx/9201075) in the stored version of the paper. this particular sequence (note 2 y's for year, 2 m's for month, 3 n's for number) does not ordinarily occur in tex (or even postscript) files so there should be no danger of unwanted replaced text. 5 Feb 92 alg-geom archive installed at eprints.math.duke.edu, running same software as at xxx.lanl.gov Feb 4 1992 there is an unadvertised option that allows automated receipt of replaced papers as well as new ones. reply yes to hepth-no if you wish to be added to the replace list. Jan 28 1992 anonymous ftp for getting files is now enabled on xxx.lanl.gov. this is primarily useful for nodes whose internet routing is configured to delay mail (notably .fr and .uk). use login: anonymous password: yourusername , the relevant directories are listings and papers (the latter has subdirectories 9108 -- 9201 ). if you are not already familiar with anonymous ftp, this is not a good place to practice. anonymous ftp for putting files will be enabled at a later date. Dec 26 1991 top ten requested papers of 1991 (not in order, self-requests excluded): 9108004 9109032 9110011 9110017 9111001 9111017 9111019 9111052 9112013 harvsamp.tex least requested: 9110023 1 Dec 1991 as many of you have astutely noticed, slac has \"volunteered\" the use of a listserv list to send out the daily title/abstract listings, and the bulk of the daily distribution (over 750 addresses at last count) has been transferred to the listserv at slacvm. this has been undertaken to eliminate certain extremely low probability (but nonetheless sufficiently nightmarish) disaster modes that would eventually arise for a list (unexpectedly) so large. with the exception of 14 nodes (each with > 10 subscribers) that were already organized to forward locally [physics.rutgers.edu, yukawa.uchicago.edu, physics.ucsb.edu, theory3.caltech.edu, fy.chalmers.se, pupphy.princeton.edu, physics.usc.edu, physics.sunysb.edu, sissa.it, amtp.cam.ac.uk, itsictp.bitnet, jpnrifp.bitnet, phys.tamu.edu, guinness.ias.edu], most email addresses have already been transferred to the list hepths-l at slacvm. [N.B. if you have received a message directing you to resubscribe and you have not done so, this is the last message you will receive.] the change is functionally transparent, except for subscriptions and cancellations. e.g. to cancel (if you are not among the above nodes), send a message to listserv@slacvm.slac.stanford.edu with a line in the body or text (i.e. not subject:) saying SIGNOFF HEPTHS-L all other requests continue to be sent to hepth@xxx.lanl.gov [not to hepth-no not to hepth-no no to hepth-not not to hepth-no which still receives a mind-boggling average of 10 misdirected messages/day] accepted papers that the slac library's crack team of experts manage to tex successfully the first time are entered into the spires database. papers that give problems of any nature are forever excluded. a phenomenology bulletin board, hepthp, may start up when ssc.gov succeeds to get machines configured properly (it is not clear to what extent this will depend on the outcome of upcoming high level negotiations with the japanese government), perhaps early '92. \\bye Nov 12 1991 in response to popular demand to limit the flux of papers, this bulletin board has adopted a referee system designed as a faithful emulation of that employed e.g. by the physical review (except that papers will typically be evaluated within a few milliseconds). the evaluation is based on a preprogrammed list of keywords, each with an assigned positive or negative integer (reflecting respectively desirable and undesirable words). the overall value of a paper is determined by the signed sum of the number of occurrences of each keyword times its associated value. papers with value < or =0 are rejected. keywords include names of current and past fads, authornames (for both paper and references), macropackages, etc. the assigned integers are programmed to vary randomly within given preset ranges to emulate individual variation among referees, and for additional realism are chosen entirely at random 20% of the time. the preset ranges evolve dynamically in a neural net that determines positive and negative contexts of word appearances via a rudimentary syntactic analysis. submitters of rejected papers will receive a detailed account of the calculation, so they will know precisely why their paper was rejected. rejected papers may not be revised and resubmitted. objections, questions, and complaints will be automatically ignored. 14 Aug 1991 e-mail interface for hep-th put on-line (PG) June 1991 Announcement of proposed hep-th archive sent out for community comment (PG) (There's also a haphazard collection of messages from '94-'96 ; plus a slightly less haphazard collection of later messages .)","title":"91 94"},{"location":"new/91-94.html#arxiv-news-archive-from-1991-1994","text":"(Haphazard collection of messages from before Summer '94; see also from '94-'96 )","title":"arXiv news archive from 1991-1994"},{"location":"new/91-94.html#july-1994","text":"First Web interface installed at babbage.sissa.it (PG).

Thus, there is a strong tendency to cross-list from hep-ph to hep-ex. The \"management\" of the e-print archives discourages such cross-listing. The original reason for creating hep-ex as a separate archive is that there are many more theoretical papers than experimental papers, and so experimental papers need a haven from the deluge of theory. This purpose is defeated if excessive numbers of hep-ph papers are cross-listed to hep-ex. A paper should be cross-listed from hep-ph to hep-ex only if it falls in one of the following categories: 1) The paper contains a nontrivial analysis of experimental data (e.g., a new fit to parton distribution functions). 2) The paper concerns specifically the uses of theoretical results in experimental analysis (e.g., the announcement of a new Monte Carlo program for the radiative corrections to Bhabha scattering) 3) The paper offers a specific criticism of an experimental analysis (e.g., a note pointing out that a certain radiative correction has been omitted in a paper posted to hep-ex) The \"management\" thus recommends: 1) That theorists cross-list to hep-ex only papers in the three categories above. 2) That experimenters subscribe to hep-ph, thus removing the need for cross-listing. 3) That all users of the archive heap scorn upon authors who cross-list from hep-ph to hep-ex for the sole purpose of garnering extra publicity.","title":"Jun 30 1994"},{"location":"new/91-94.html#apr-30-1994","text":"actual physicist complaint: Well, I personally don't have the slightest idea what \"point your www client at http://xxx.lanl.gov/\" means. ...

MESSAGE OF CRUCIAL IMPORTANCE CONCERNING hep-th/9209055: the 16 figures for this paper had been (correctly) submitted as a single uuencoded compressed tar file using the `add' command. the uuencoded file exceeded 100kb so was split up by the outgoing mail routine for e-mail requestors (due to limits imposed by certain mail routers). NOW HERE COMES THE SUBTLE PART: *your* unix mailer, on *receipt* of this mail, adds both a header *and* a blank line at the end of the file. that means if you mindlessly concatenated the two parts after removing headers with an editor, the *blank line* prevented proper uudecoding and you lost three figures. if you as well removed the blank line, then everything worked fine. BUT THERE IS A BETTER WAY: all modern unix mailers have a command w (for write) in addition to s (for save). the w command automatically strips off the header and trailing blank line, so you can simply say, for example, w 1 2 figures.enc to combine mail messages 1 and 2 into an uncorrupted file figures.enc without header. if your mailer does not have a properly functioning w command, you should complain. (while this system does not make commercial endorsements, it should be noted that at least one unix operating system has as well a mail application that automatically uuencodes and tar compresses multiple files dragged into the send window, and performs the inverse process on receipt of mail.) there also exist uudecode, tar, and uncompress utilities for vaxes. there is little excuse for persistent postscript figure fear.","title":"Sep 16 1992"},{"location":"new/91-94.html#aug-4-1992","text":"the full preprint databases hep-th, hep-ph, and gr-qc at xxx.lanl.gov are duplicated at babbage.sissa.it (italy), and automatically updated once a day (shortly after the daily mailings go out). you decide which address is more efficient for e-mail and anonymous ftp, e.g. european addresses can avoid the electronic trans-atlantic round trip by sending messages to hep-th@babbage.sissa.it, hep-ph@babbage.sissa.it, or gr-qc@babbage.sissa.it. if you enjoy requesting the same paper multiple times within a 5 minute period, babbage.sissa.it is the place to do it. if you need to practice anonymous ftp, babbage.sissa.it is the place to do it. commands that change the database (put replace add cross, subscribe cancel) must still be sent to xxx.lanl.gov for the time being. other commands (get find listings ...) are identical to those on xxx.lanl.gov.","title":"Aug 4 1992"},{"location":"new/91-94.html#aug-2-1992","text":"in response to popular demand, an automated e-mail address database for physicists, e-mail@xxx.lanl.gov is now operational. commands are: subscribe, cancel, find, help, comment to enter yourself, send a message To: e-mail@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: subscribe your full name where \"your full name\" is your name, not your e-mail address (the latter is extracted automatically from mail header).

Strominger, 30 pp \\ We construct a new class of exactly solvable string theories by generalizing the heterotic construction to connect a left-moving non-compact Lorentzian coset algebra with a right-moving supersymmetric Euclidean coset algebra. These theories have no spacetime supersymmetry, and a generalized set of anomaly constraints allows only a model with four spacetime dimensions, low energy gauge groups SU(3) and spontaneously broken SU(2)xU(1), and three families of quarks and leptons. The model has a complex dilaton whose radial mode is automatically eaten in a Higgs-like solution to the cosmological constant problem, while its angular mode survives to solve the strong CP problem at low energy. By adroit use of the theory of parabolic cylinder functions, we calculate the mass spectrum of this model to all orders in the string loop expansion. The results are within 5% of measured values, with the discrepancy attributable to experimental error. We predict a top quark mass of $173 \\pm 2$ GeV, and no physical Higgs particle in the spectrum. \\\\","title":"1 Apr 1992"},{"location":"new/91-94.html#mar-31-1992","text":"REPLACED PAPERS: numerous people have requested that submitters of replaced papers include a (commented out) header in the revised body of the paper that overviews the changes. in addition a brief parenthetical note following the revised title should indicate the nature of the changes (e.g. major conceptual changes, minor grammatical changes, corrected references, corrected authors, corrected tex errors, ...)","title":"Mar 31 1992"},{"location":"new/91-94.html#mar-11-1992","text":"local network reconfiguration delayed until unknown time thu 12 Mar between 0100 - 0600 MST (0900 - 1400 GMT). random mail delays likely throughout day. new IP# for xxx.lanl.gov to be 128.165.23.9 (although should never be necessary for systems properly configured to use remote lookup tables). this system has logged an increasing number of attempts at telnet access. there is no reason to telnet to xxx.lanl.gov. if you are trying to use anonymous ftp, then type `ftp', not `telnet'. this system also screens ftp access for forged packets (a standard hacker game) by tracing back and confirming remote hostname. occasionally this has meant denied access to legitimate requests from improperly configured machines: if you have this problem, it will continue until it is fixed at your end.

During the test phase, authors should confirm that their TeX source can produce PostScript automatically. This can be done either by e-mail or via the www interface. Either procedure will run an automated script on your TeX source (and attachments) to try to generate (hyper-)PostScript, and you will receive a message in response indicating success or failure. If the archive can't easily tex your source, then it is unlikely that anyone else can either (making your submission at best inconvenient, at worst useless). If you can't figure out what the problem is, send a comment to the archive in question using the `comment' command. If you don't fix your submission, then everyone who tries to get the ps version of your paper will receive a message stating that it is \"author error\", and that the author has been notified of the problem. Whenever you replace your paper, you should re-issue the psgenerate command to verify that your submission still works. Notes: At the time of the daily mailings, auto ps generation will be run on any submissions whose authors have not already done so, but by then there may be a longer delay before authors can correct trivial errors. There is a remarkable correlation between low quality content and unprocessability. Incidentally, if you `put' only PostScript thinking that it was more convenient than TeX for readers, please think again. TeX + attachments is a preferable format for archiving your paper [more information can be found in formats.txt , available via the `get' command] and allows automated hyperlinkages [see e.g. hypertex ] for viewing either via hyperPS browsers [such as newest version of ghostview] or inclusion via distillation to pdf [viewable by adobe acrobat and soon to be incorporated into netscape and other www clients].) Rather than doing your readers a service, by submitting PostScript you instead do them a disservice by submitting something substantially less portable (and user-supplied postscript has more than its share of problems -- the postscript generated here is uniformly of higher quality than generated elsewhere). After the test phase, we will migrate (probably sometime in late december) to a simpler one-step submission format, which will allow gleeful rejection of submissions that cannot be processed automatically. The current awkward system is only intended as a temporary remedial measure to facilitate a smoother changeover to the more efficient target system. Watch this space for further details.

(if you are not sure whether you are a physicist or a mathematician, then it is appropriate to use q-alg and not to cross-list to hep-th). next: quant-ph@xxx (fundamental problems of quantum theory) and math-ph (watch this space) Dec 94 The hep-lat archive has been moved to xxx.lanl.gov as the primary site -- for the time being it will continue to be mirrored to ftp.scri.fsu.edu. 1 Nov 94 Starting 1 Nov '94, submitters should be certain to use a \"structured\" title/author field, e.g. \\\\ Title: Recent Seminal Results Authors: Author One and Author Two Comments: 3 pages, latex, no figures Report-no: EFI-94-11 \\\\ abstract \\\\ body of paper Nov 1 1994 three notes: 1) there is a new version of uufiles (see attached message below) to enhance the quality of your life 2) long little-known feature: the www interface automatically translates appearances of url's of the form http://hostname/path or ftp://hostname/path that appear as plain text in titles or abstracts into hot links. for example: \"for associated mpeg file, see http://myhost.domain/file.mpg\" when accessed via www pages at xxx.lanl.gov (or babbage.sissa.it) views as \"for associated mpeg file, see \" (for some examples, search cond-mat via www for the string http ) 3) for the purposes of automatically compiling references and citation lists (e.g. a significant aid to the slac spires-hep database), it is useful to include the citation to the arch-ive/papernum in your reference list when known (e.g. a string such as hep-ph/9409201 is easily harvested). this will also facilitate automatic network hyperlinks of references from within papers (see e.g. http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/ ). fourth note: it is possible to retrieve just the past week of title/author listings a) via e-mail, Subject: list pastweek b) via anon ftp, as the file arch-ive/listings/pastweek c) via www, linked from arch-ive home page or from overall form page 1 Nov 94 Due to many reliability complaints, and the difficulty for Los Alamos personnel to administer the astro-ph cond-mat and funct-an archives properly from remote, these archives have been moved from babbage.sissa.it to xxx.lanl.gov as the primary location. They will continue to be mirrored to babbage.sissa.it. This will at long last ensure the same level of functionality and reliability as the rest of the archive system. Oct 31 1994 For physics Job/Conference announcements, point your www client at http://xxx.lanl.gov/Announce/ This system has long been inundated by requests to disseminate physics job and conference announcements, but has consciously restricted to research dissemination alone. But with the widespread usage of WorldWideWeb clients, automated short-term archival systems are now significantly easier to establish and maintain. Posting to the above is via www and can either be full plain text or can include hyperlinks to further information maintained at remote servers. (Entries can be removed at any time by original submitter.) There are no plans at present to establish a parallel e-mail interface (we could do it, but it would be wrong) since form compliant www clients exist for all platforms (for more info see the www faq, http://sunsite.unc.edu/boutell/faq/www_faq.html , also available via e-mail e.g. To: hep-th@xxx.lanl.gov Subject: get wwwfaq ). Note also that the above may serve as well as the prototype for an eventual public commentary system associated to the e-print archives (with full author control over attachments to any given submission). Oct 1994 note that there is a new version (10/94) of uufiles (used for tarring, compressing, and uuencoding files for e-mail transmission on unix systems). why tar? because it is a convenient way for people who receive a file with many parts to unpack it automatically into its component parts properly named (without messy cutting and pasting). why compress? because filesizes are typically reduced by at least a factor of two why uuencode? because compressed files are binary and will be corrupted when sent via e-mail. (uuencode translates to ascii specifically for e-mail transmission. note that raw postscript as well can be corrupted by e-mail transmission due to occasional long lines or entry into bitmap mode --- uuencoding [after compression, since .ps tends to compress well] eliminates any problems) what's new: the new version of uufiles solves two long-standing nuisances: older versions of uuencode that use ' ' instead of '`' (i.e. space instead of backquote, as still found on most suns) now have this automatically corrected, and versions of uuencode (e.g. on sysV hp) that assign mode 0 to stdin have this corrected to 644. uufiles no longer tars single files, instead just compresses. uufiles has two new options: 1) uufiles -gz uses gzip compression, and 2) uufiles -gz -9 uses the slowest compression method (i.e. the optimal compression). evidently to use this, you must have the gnu gzip/gunzip utilities installed on your system (.gz compression frequently does better than a factor of two better than .Z compression on postscript files -- for example, the 56 .ps files associated with hep-th/9409195 [a total of 1.7Mb] compressed as figs.tar.Z = 542kb , whereas figs.tar.gz = 196kb . [of course the recipient must have the gunzip utility installed to unpack, but this should by now be commonplace since these utilities have been freely distributed for years.]) the new version of uufiles is 100% downwardly compatible in usage, so there is no reason not to download and install even if you don't yet have gzip/gunzip. use get uufiles via e-mail interface (also available in papers/macros via anon ftp, or via www under macros). more frequently asked questions: why am i instructed to submit first the .tex file as a `put', then submit the uufiled figures afterwards via the `fig command', rather than simply submit the .tex (or .dvi) together with any .ps figs (or other attachments) all uufiled together in the first place? this is recommended as a compromise for the electronically disadvantaged. those who for whatever reason cannot unpack the uuencoded compressed tar files (despite the existence of these utilities on most platforms [vax/vms, mac, pc included]) at least get to see the tex file. of course any author is free to do as he/she pleases (happily complaints go directly to submitter, not to here), but better solutions can be implemented as soon as modernized network clients are uniformly in use (allowing these systems to discard artifacts of their e-mail based origins). but why can't i already just POST a mime-formatted multipart transmission to the server via a form page from my www client? sadly, because most current www clients are either too primitive or are broken. the next version of mosaic may at least properly support a mailto: form which will facilitate pre-formatting submissions. other clients are on the way, but it will be (at least) many months before the situation stabilizes and suitable standards are in place. Oct 1994 Web interface rewritten in perl (hartill/PG) Jul 28 1994 for information on \"hypertex\", point your www client at http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/ . Some background: It is easier to add hypertext capability to TeX than to simulate the TeX typesetting environment within www browsers. (And for scientific text, total author control over formatting and fonts is frequently preferred.) A simple standard is to insert \\special commands that add the necessary structure to the .dvi file. For example, \\def\\href#1#2{\\special{html:<a href=\"#1\">}{#2}\\special{html:</a>}} allows one to surround text with the necessary specials, so that Here is a link to \\href{http ://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/}{hypertex} will insert the desired anchored text with a hotlink to an arbitrary network URL (including e.g. photos, movies, sound files, mathematica files, etc.) The object is not only to provide hyperlink functionality to external (network) resources, but also to provide a means of transmitting much of the important structural and contextual information (sections, subsections, equations, references, ...) already contained in the underlying .tex for suitable gui postprocessing, whether directly by .dvi previewer or after higher level translation (e.g. to .pdf [Adobe's modification of .ps that supports a hyperlink overlay --- for which viewers will soon be generally available for unix/pc/mac]). The above hypertex URL contains info on dvi previewers that already implement this functionality (for nextstep and X), contains pointers to modified macropackages (latex and harvmac/lanlmac) that *automatically* insert the \\specials for internal eqns, refs, etc., and also has links to some sample hyper .dvi files compiled from pre-existing source (including random submissions to hep-th et al.) that provide edifying demos.

[users who supply only the final postscript output from tex source are again reminded that this is a poor and much less portable choice (produced at fixed resolution without hyperlinks), and later in january the www interface will offer other resolution (300/400/600 dpi) and font choices (unimbedded type 1 PS), as well as dvi and pdf (U.S. taxpayer dollars busily at work).] This change will mean in particular that the \"figure\" and \"add\" commands will no longer be supported, and multi-part submissions should instead be packaged as a single gzipped (or compressed) tar file.

During the test phase, authors should confirm that their TeX source can produce PostScript automatically. This can be done either by e-mail or via the www interface. Either procedure will run an automated script on your TeX source (and attachments) to try to generate (hyper-)PostScript, and you will receive a message in response indicating success or failure. If the archive can't easily tex your source, then it is unlikely that anyone else can either (making your submission at best inconvenient, at worst useless). If you can't figure out what the problem is, send a comment to the archive in question using the `comment' command. If you don't fix your submission, then everyone who tries to get the ps version of your paper will receive a message stating that it is \"author error\", and that the author has been notified of the problem. Whenever you replace your paper, you should re-issue the psgenerate command to verify that your submission still works. Notes: At the time of the daily mailings, auto ps generation will be run on any submissions whose authors have not already done so, but by then there may be a longer delay before authors can correct trivial errors. There is a remarkable correlation between low quality content and unprocessability. Incidentally, if you `put' only PostScript thinking that it was more convenient than TeX for readers, please think again. TeX + attachments is a preferable format for archiving your paper [more information can be found in formats.txt , available via the `get' command] and allows automated hyperlinkages [see e.g. hypertex ] for viewing either via hyperPS browsers [such as newest version of ghostview] or inclusion via distillation to pdf [viewable by adobe acrobat and soon to be incorporated into netscape and other www clients].) Rather than doing your readers a service, by submitting PostScript you instead do them a disservice by submitting something substantially less portable (and user-supplied postscript has more than its share of problems -- the postscript generated here is uniformly of higher quality than generated elsewhere). After the test phase, we will migrate (probably sometime in late december) to a simpler one-step submission format, which will allow gleeful rejection of submissions that cannot be processed automatically. The current awkward system is only intended as a temporary remedial measure to facilitate a smoother changeover to the more efficient target system. Watch this space for further details.

(uuencode translates to ascii specifically for e-mail transmission. note that raw postscript as well can be corrupted by e-mail transmission due to occasional long lines or entry into bitmap mode --- uuencoding [after compression, since .ps tends to compress well] eliminates any problems) what's new: the new version of uufiles solves two long-standing nuisances: older versions of uuencode that use ' ' instead of '`' (i.e. space instead of backquote, as still found on most suns) now have this automatically corrected, and versions of uuencode (e.g. on sysV hp) that assign mode 0 to stdin have this corrected to 644. uufiles no longer tars single files, instead just compresses. uufiles has two new options: 1) uufiles -gz uses gzip compression, and 2) uufiles -gz -9 uses the slowest compression method (i.e. the optimal compression). evidently to use this, you must have the gnu gzip/gunzip utilities installed on your system (.gz compression frequently does better than a factor of two better than .Z compression on postscript files -- for example, the 56 .ps files associated with hep-th/9409195 [a total of 1.7Mb] compressed as figs.tar.Z = 542kb , whereas figs.tar.gz = 196kb . [of course the recipient must have the gunzip utility installed to unpack, but this should by now be commonplace since these utilities have been freely distributed for years.]) the new version of uufiles is 100% downwardly compatible in usage, so there is no reason not to download and install even if you don't yet have gzip/gunzip. use get uufiles via e-mail interface (also available in papers/macros via anon ftp, or via www under macros). more frequently asked questions: why am i instructed to submit first the .tex file as a `put', then submit the uufiled figures afterwards via the `fig command', rather than simply submit the .tex (or .dvi) together with any .ps figs (or other attachments) all uufiled together in the first place? this is recommended as a compromise for the electronically disadvantaged. those who for whatever reason cannot unpack the uuencoded compressed tar files (despite the existence of these utilities on most platforms [vax/vms, mac, pc included]) at least get to see the tex file. of course any author is free to do as he/she pleases (happily complaints go directly to submitter, not to here), but better solutions can be implemented as soon as modernized network clients are uniformly in use (allowing these systems to discard artifacts of their e-mail based origins). but why can't i already just POST a mime-formatted multipart transmission to the server via a form page from my www client? sadly, because most current www clients are either too primitive or are broken. the next version of mosaic may at least properly support a mailto: form which will facilitate pre-formatting submissions. other clients are on the way, but it will be (at least) many months before the situation stabilizes and suitable standards are in place.","title":"Oct 1994"},{"location":"new/94-96.html#oct-1994_1","text":"Web interface rewritten in perl (hartill/PG)","title":"Oct 1994"},{"location":"new/94-96.html#jul-28-1994","text":"for information on \"hypertex\", point your www client at http://xxx.lanl.gov/hypertex/ .

In a variety of ways, these researchers are contributing towards making biology a quantitative science. With this letter, we announce the formation of the q-bio archive ( http://arXiv.org/archive/q-bio , see also http://arXiv.org/new/q-bio ), which aims to serve the need of this emerging community. If you and your colleagues have active interest in quantitative biology (including but not limited to biological physics, computational biology, neural science, systems biology, bioinformatics, mathematical biology, and theoretical biology), we urge you to subscribe to the archive and submit (p)reprints to it. Both theoretical and experimental contributions are welcome, and subscription is freely accessible over the internet to all members of the scientific community. Instructions for registration, submission, and subscription to the archive can be found at http://arXiv.org/help/registerhelp , http://arXiv.org/help/uploads , and http://arXiv.org/help/subscribe . The q-bio archive has grown out of a well-established series of e-Print archives accessible at http://arxiv.org/ . The number of biology-related submissions to these archives has risen steadily over the last several years, and is averaging over 40/month so far in 2003. Unfortunately, these submissions are currently scattered across a number of sub-archives (including physics, cond-mat, nonlinear science, math, etc.), reflecting mostly the \"home field\" of the contributors rather than the subject matters of their submissions. Many colleagues have expressed the desire to have a centralized archive to share their latest results, and to learn about related findings by others in this field. The q-bio archive is designed to address this problem. It is organized mainly according to different categories of biological processes and partitioned according to their scales in space and time. The categories http://arXiv.org/new/q-bio range from molecular and sub-cellular structures to tissues and organs, from the kinetics of molecules to population and evolutionary dynamics. In addition, a separate category is devoted to method-dominated contributions, including computational algorithms, experimental methods, as well as novel approaches to analyzing experimental data. All submissions are required to choose a primary category, with the option for one or more secondary categories. Subscribers of the archive will receive by e-mail the title/abstracts of all submissions in their chosen categories on a regular basis. A large number of bio-related submissions to the e-Print archives during the past decade have already been identified and categorized according to the above scheme using an automated procedure. They can be accessed at http://arxiv.org/archive/q-bio . Please note that the current list of categories is a compromise between the large number of active subject matters in biology and the areas of quantitative biology where the e-print archives have received significant contributions during the past several years. The subject list will undoubtedly be updated as the major active areas develop/shift in time. This continuous structuring of the archive is overseen by an advisory committee. It consists of a number of well-established biologists, William F. Loomis (UCSD), Chuck Stevens (Salk), Gary Stormo (WUSTL), Diethard Tautz (Cologne), together with a number of dedicated volunteers who will serve as \"moderators\" for each category listed at http://arXiv.org/new/q-bio .

It is our hope that the q-bio archive can eventually provide a greater community benefit than just a depository of (p)reprints. So far, there lacks a coherent forum devoted to quantitative issues in biology. Consequently, it has been difficult to follow progress in this discipline. We hope that the q-bio archive will serve as a virtual meeting point for all quantitative-minded scientists with serious interest in biology. Alternatively, the archive may be viewed as a virtual \"half-way\" house through which quantitative scientists can interact and support each other as they find their ways into the complex world of biological science. If successful, the open but focused environment provided by the q-bio archive may facilitate the maturation and self-organization of quantitative biology into a coherent field that contributes positively to both biology and the traditional quantitative sciences. Reaching this goal will require participation from every individual in this discipline. We look forward to meeting you at the archive.

This field, whose creation was marked by such important breakthroughs as the Modern Portfolio Theory of Markowitz, Capital Asset Pricing Model of Sharpe, Lintner, Mossin and Treynor, and Option Pricing Theory of Black, Scholes and Merton, has always relied on the power of mathematical tools and methods to discover and describe the mechanisms behind the workings of financial markets. This reliance has continued to grow with the complexity of the problems considered, and has led to many fruitful examples of cross-pollination of the ideas between the fields. The rapid growth of the financial industry has brought together many researchers with diverse scientific backgrounds who now work in banks, investment management, insurance and other companies which rely on innovation for the growth of their business. In academia as well, we have seen a growing number of cross-disciplinary efforts, from joint seminars and symposia to cross-departmental programs such as those offering the increasingly popular financial engineering degrees. To further promote this convergence of ideas and stimulate the dialogue between disciplines as well as between the academics and practitioners, we announce the formation of the new Quantitative Finance (q-fin) archive . If you and your colleagues have active interest in quantitative finance, we urge you to subscribe to the archive and submit (p)reprints to it. Both theoretical contributions and those related to practical applications are welcome, and subscription is freely accessible over the internet to all members of the scientific community.

The number of finance-related submissions to these archives has risen steadily over the last several years. Unfortunately, these submissions are currently scattered across a number of sub-archives (including physics, cond-mat, nonlinear science, math, etc.), reflecting mostly the \"home field\" of the contributors rather than the subject matters of their submissions. At the same time, well- established electronic repositories within the social sciences field, such as SSRN, RepEc/IDEAS and others, while containing a wealth of articles on quantitative finance, do not generally offer as detailed a coverage and classification to this field as its practical prominence and throughput of new papers would suggest. As a result, while the existing repositories attract many academic contributions, only a subset of practitioners tends to submit their work to these sites. On the other hand, a handful of sites well-known amongst practitioners, such as defaultrisk.com, wilmott.com, and others have either been narrowly targeted at the particular subset of quantitative finance or have not attracted many academic contributors. Many colleagues have expressed the desire to have a centralized archive with clear and concise content classification to share their latest results, and to learn about related findings by others in this field. We believe that both the organizational structure of arXiv.org, as well as its functional flexibility and robustness, make it a natural fit for the improved and extended repository of quantitative finance papers on the internet that would be open to and actively used by researchers from all academic backgrounds and from industry alike. The new q-fin archive is organized mainly according to different applications of methodologies within quantitative finance, broken out into four main such applications - valuation, risk management, portfolio management and trading. We have also included two separate categories dedicated to the development of statistical and computational methodologies since these methods often have significant importance by themselves, and can have multiple applications in different areas. Finally we have included a category for general methods which will serve as an outlet for those contributions that do not easily fit in the other categories. The list below outlines the initial sub-categories and gives a brief description of the types of contributions expected to be found in each sub-category: q-fin.PR - Pricing of Securities Models for pricing, hedging and relative valuation of traded securities, their derivatives, and structured products. q-fin.RM - Risk Management Methodologies for measuring and managing financial risks in trading, banking, insurance, corporate and other applications. q-fin.PM - Portfolio Management Models for portfolio selection and optimization, capital allocation and investment strategies. q-fin.TR - Trading and Microstructure Market Models of market microstructure, liquidity, exchange and auction design, automated (electronic) trading, agent-based modeling and market-making. q-fin.ST - Statistical Finance Statistical, econometric and econophysics analyses with applications to financial markets and economic data. q-fin.CP - Computational Finance Development of computational methods and their applications to financial markets, including Monte Carlo, PDE, lattice and other analytical and numerical methods. q-fin.GN - General Finance Development of general quantitative methodologies with applications in financial markets and economics. All submissions are required to choose a primary category, with the option for one or more secondary categories. Subscribers of the archive will receive by e-mail the title/abstracts of all submissions in their chosen categories on a regular basis. A large number of finance-related submissions to the arXiv.org e-Print archives during the past decade have already been identified and re-classified according to the above scheme. We thank Pierre-Alain Reigneron (CFM) for helping with this task. These earlier submissions will be accessible at http://arxiv.org/archive/q-fin along with new Quantitative Finance submissions.

See http://arxiv.org/archive/stat . The existing math.ST category will be linked to new stat.TH category. Submissions to one will automatically appear in the other. We urge researchers in statistics and related fields to submit their preprints to this archive. Both theoretical and applied contributions are welcome. The archive is open access. The Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) and the Bernoulli Society are planning to post all articles published in their statistics journals ( Annals of Statistics , Statistical Science , Annals of Applied Statistics , Electronic Journal of Statistics and Statistics Surveys ) and statistics articles in the journal Bernoulli , while papers in the probability journals Annals of Probability , Annals of Applied Probability and Probability Surveys , and probability articles in Bernoulli will continue to be posted to math.PR.
