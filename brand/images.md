arXiv's branding uses both photographic and illustrated imagery.

##Photos
Photographs are colorized in our brand colors of Warm Grey, Bright Blue, Dark Blue, and Salmon. Our curated photo collection represent academic spaces, researchers, labs, and other research-related subject matter. Visit the [![arXiv photo library](box-library-link)

Photographs can be overlayed with a [highlighted type treatment](typography#highlighting), with the text offset from the photo edge.

##Illustrations
Illustrations are used to represent abstract concepts or stakeholder groups. The illustrative style we use is informal and friendly. It is not slick or polished and instead emphasizes thrift. People are represented by stick figures, ala [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/), but without gender markers. Visit the [![arXiv illustration library](box-library-link)
