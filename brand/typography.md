Typographic treatments are at the heart of arXiv's identity. Maintaining consistency across all communications is, in large part, achieved through consistency of type. But within this framework there are options and a lot of room for creativity. Use the guidelines below to maintain consistency and spontaneity.

Base styles are built around the Freight font, both Text Pro and Sans Pro. The Freight family draw from Cornell Universityâ€™s branding and connect us stylistically with our parent organization. From this baseline we have developed several treatments that range from elegant and sophisticated to edgy and bold.

###Architectural
This architectural treatments of the type allows for endless variations. The guiding principles are elegance, brevity, and high legibility. Contrasting font sizes and interesting interplay of letterforms provide visual interest without sacrificing the readibility of the text or the

###Intertwined Letterforms
We also use intertwined letterforms to echo the arms of the chi in our logo.

##Highlighting
We use text highlighting in two contexts:
1. When displaying our [tagline](tagline), and
2. For quotes and other critical highlights.

The highlight color for the tagline is always black with white type, as in this example:
![example quote from annual report](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-full}

Quotes and other highlights use less contrast and a wider variety of colors. For callouts, we use Bright Blue with white type as shown here:
![example callout in blue from newsletter](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-full}

 For quotes, we use Light Warm Grey with Warm Grey type, as with this example:
