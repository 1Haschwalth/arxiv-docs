Our identifying mark, vetted and approved by Cornell University, achieves the *legibility, memorability and legal defensibility* arXiv needs. Our logo is ready to help us share a consistent, intentional, and meaningful message about who we are with the world. That message is: arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.

The arXiv logo nods to the past with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s, while also being boldly forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value as a place of connection.

Using our logo consistently over time will build up rich layers of meaning with our community, and it’s value to arXiv will increase exponentially. The legal protection we have over the logo will help us also protect the arXiv service that we all love.

##Primary Logo
The primary arXiv logo is our default mark seen in most applications. It showcases two primary brand colors: Dark Grey and Cornell Red.

![arXiv primary logo](images/brand-logo-primary.jpg){.mkd-img-60}

###Spacing
A clear area around the logo prevents any nearby graphic elements from interfering with the name’s impact. The primary logo configuration should maintain spacing around the logo equal to the height of the ‘a’, as shown.

##Alternate Logos
The arXiv logo is available in various alternate colors for special use cases.

On a dark background, the dark mode version can be used for greater contrast:
![arXiv logo dark mode](images/brand-logo-dark-mode.jpg){.mkd-img-60}

The alternate salmon color can be used where Cornell Red is inappropriate, while staying in the same warm color family:
![arXiv logo salmon](images/brand-logo-salmon.jpg){.mkd-img-60}

Single color versions can be used when a simpler, higher contrast version is needed such as single color print applications:
![arXiv logo in single color black](images/brand-logo-black.jpg){.mkd-img-left}
![arXiv logo in single color red](images/brand-logo-red.jpg){.mkd-img-right}

##Logomark
arXiv's logomark is for use where space is at a premium and the full size logo cannot be used. These include mobile applications and when an icon is needed.

The logomark is available in the same variations as the primary logo:

![arXiv logo in single color black](images/brand-logomark-primary.jpg){.mkd-img-thumb}
![arXiv logo in single color black](images/brand-logomark-dark-mode.jpg){.mkd-img-thumb}
![arXiv logo in single color black](images/brand-logomark-salmon.jpg){.mkd-img-thumb}
![arXiv logo in single color black](images/brand-logomark-black.jpg){.mkd-img-thumb}
![arXiv logo in single color black](images/brand-logomark-red.jpg){.mkd-img-thumb}

##Lockups and Extensions
Lockups are used for internal arXiv projects with unique impact and a need for distinct branding, or for pre-approved partnership use.

Logo extensions can be created on a custom basis for distinct projects, like arXiv Check:
![arXiv Check logo](images/brand-logo-check.jpg){.mkd-img-60}

###Spacing
The lockup configuration should maintain spacing around the logo equal to the height of the ‘a’,  as shown:

##Supergraphic
arXiv's supergraphic provides a new twist on an old favorite: the arXiv "smileybones". Quirky, scrappy, inscrutable, and whaaaat? are just some of the ways this icon has been described over the years. The updated icon celebrates the pixelation of the original 90's image, and it's rebellious nature, with a modernized and high quality homage. For fun, here is a [brief history](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-story-behind-the-arXiv-org-favicon) of the original icon.

The smileybones supergraphic should be used in applications where it can display on a large enough scale for impact, and where a bit of informality is appropriate, such as in the examples below.
