##Primary Logo
Our mark, vetted and approved by Cornell University, achieves the *legibility, memorability and legal defensibility* arXiv needs. Our logo is ready to help us share a consistent, intentional, and meaningful message about who we are with the world. That message is: arXiv is a place of connection, linking together people and ideas, and connecting them with the world of open science.

The arXiv logo looks to the future and nods to the past, with a font that pays homage to arXiv’s birth in the 90’s while also being forward looking. The arms of the ‘X’ retain stylistic elements of the ‘chi’ in our name, with a lengthened top left and lower right branch. Symbolically, the intertwining of the arms at the heart of the logo captures the spirit of arXiv’s core value as a place of connection.

###Spacing
A clear area around the logo prevents any nearby graphic elements from interfering with the name’s impact. This distance is the minimum amount of space that must surround the logo. Create the clear area in proportion to the type size. The “X” represents the height the “a” in arXiv.

The logo should not be altered in any way, redrawn, used in an unspecified color or reproduced on a background that will impair its visual recognition. Use of the name arXiv and associated logos, web addresses, and colors are only allowed with explicit written permission from the arXiv management team.

Using our logo consistently and creatively over time will build up rich layers of meaning with our community, and it’s value to arXiv will increase exponentially.

##Alternate Logos
The arXiv logo is available in various alternate colors for special use cases.

On a dark background, the dark mode version can be used for greater contrast:
![arXiv logo dark mode](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}

The alternate salmon color can be used where Cornell Red is inappropriate, while staying in the same warm color family:
![arXiv logo salmon](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}

Single color versions can be used when our usual colors do not provide sufficient contrast, or in single color print applications:
![arXiv logo in single color black](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}
![arXiv logo in single color red](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}
![arXiv logo in single color white](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}


##Lockups and Extensions
Lockups are used for internal arXiv projects with unique impact and a need for distinct branding, and for approved partnerships.

The primary lockup configuration should maintain spacing around the logo equal to the height of the ‘a’,  as shown:
![arXiv Labs logo extension](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}
![arXiv Labs logo with grid](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}

Alternate Horizontal lockups can be used when vertical space is at a premium, maintaining spacin equal to the height of the lower section of the 'a', as shown:
![arXiv Labs logo horizontal](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}
![arXiv Labs logo horizontal with grid](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}

Logo extensions can be created on a custom basis for distinct projects, like arXiv Check:

![arXiv Check logo with grid](images/image_name.jpg){.mkd-img-left .mkd-img-border}

##Supergraphic
arXiv's supergraphic provides a new twist on an old favorite: the arXiv "smileybones". Quirky, scrappy, inscrutable, and whaaaat? are just some of the ways this icon has been described over the years. The updated icon celebrates the pixelation of the original 90's image, and it's rebellious nature, with a modernized and high quality homage. For fun, here is a [brief history](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-story-behind-the-arXiv-org-favicon) of the original icon.

The supergraphic should be used in large format applications only, and that call for a bit of informality, such as in the examples below.
